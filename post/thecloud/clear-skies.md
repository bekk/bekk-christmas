There's no doubt that we're leaving behind a challenging year, but we're [also](https://elm.christmas/) [leaving](https://functional.christmas/) [behind](https://javascript.christmas/) [nine](https://kotlin.christmas/) [other](https://react.christmas/) [great ](https://security.christmas/)[advent](https://strategy.christmas/) [calendars](https://talks.christmas/), [and](https://ux.christmas/) a [podcast](https://www.innovation.christmas/)!

I encourage you to spend some time reading those, as they are bustling with great content. 

As we wrap up our advent calendar and this year is coming to an end, it's time to have [20/20 vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity) on 2021. 

On behalf of all of the authors behind cloud.christmas, I wish you a happy holiday and a happy new year.
