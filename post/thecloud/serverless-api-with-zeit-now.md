  By now, you have probably heard about serverless applications. You know, the
  applications where you focus on the code and let some third-party cloud
  provider manage the infrastructure and deployment process. With serverless
  functions offered by these cloud providers, it is suprisingly easy to create
  modular and serverless APIs that can easily be deployed with one command.
  Let's dig into how.

ZEIT Now is a cloud platform that allows you to [deploy static sites](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/introduction/#creating-a-project-and-deploying) from the commando line with the single command `now`. With [Now 2.0](https://zeit.co/blog/now-2), the platform also offers deployment and execution of serverless functions. These functions works by providing respones to HTTP requests and can be written in Go, Python or JavaScript.

In this article, we will explore how Santa Claus can use serverless functions to  create a simple üéÅ-list API for all his helpers to use.

### Setting up the project
Before we start, we need to prepare some stuff.

* Sign up at [https://zeit.co/signup]().
* Install `now-cli` with `npm i -g now` (or with Yarn if you prefer).
* Login with `now login`.
* Initilize the folder structure with `mkdir gift-lists && cd gift-lists`.
* Next, initlize the project with `npm init` to create a `package.json`.
