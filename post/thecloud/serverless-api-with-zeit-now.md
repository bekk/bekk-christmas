  By now, you have probably heard about serverless applications. You know, the
  applications where you focus on the code and let some thrid-party cloud
  provider manage the infrastructure and deployment process. With serverless
  functions and some smart folder structering, it is possible to create modular
  and serverless APIs that can easily be deployed with one command. Lets dig
  into how.
