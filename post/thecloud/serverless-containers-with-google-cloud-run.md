  Do you want to run stateless container-based services, but don't need the
  bells and whistles of Kubernetes and the overhead with configuration and
  management of a full-fledged Kubernetes cluster? 


  Are you intrigued by serverless and the _pay-what-you-use_ model of existing
  [FaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service) platforms, but
  find the supported languages and frameworks too limited? 


  Then come along and have a look at _Google Cloud Run_ - a fully managed
  serverless execution environment that lets you run stateless HTTP-driven
  containers. It's almost like functions, but where _you_ supply a container
  with the web runtime and pay exactly for what you use billed to the nearest
  100 milliseconds.

Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless execution environment that lets you run stateless HTTP-driven containers, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. You don't have to set up and manage a Kubernetes cluster, and you don't pay for compute instances idling around when your service are not handling any traffic.
