title: Uffizzi App Platform
ingress: Uffuzzi is a new cloud platform that helps developers deploy and host
  applications with no cloud infrastructure knowlege. Uffuzzi is similar to
  Heroku in many ways, but it is built on top of GKE which means that it has a
  very solid and scalable foundation. Let's deploy a simple python web
  application to Uffuzzi.
