title: Have a merry hybrid Christmas
ingress: 2020 has been, and still is a special year for us because of the
  pandemic dominating most of the news (fake or not). Despite the fact that he
  apparently is immune, it has still been a special year also for Santa Claus.
  2020 is the year when he begun his journey towards the cloud for his
  on-northpole infrastructure.

## The challenge

With a growing number of people on the planet, every year the number of presents to be made by Santa Claus and his elves are increasing. Consequently Santa Claus needs to improve his efficiency, not just the way he produces content for all the gifts but also the way he and his team maintains, improves and extends the on-northpole infrastructure. An increased number of servers, of course requires more man hours to maintain and assure that everything is working as expected. Moving parts of this to the cloud will help him be prepared for growth and hopefully also free up time from his valuable elves.

Performing a lift-and-shift operation was not possible for several reasons, hence he wanted to make sure all new work was done in the cloud - but still being able to have existing infrastructure on-northpole - making up a hybrid approach.

The on-northpole infrastructure consists of mainly windows servers and he chose the cloud platform to be Micrsoft Azure. In this post we will look into how he established the connection between Azure and on-northpole to assure data from on-northpole would be available seemlessly in the cloud.
