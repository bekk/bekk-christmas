title: How to share data in the IoT era
ingress: Welcome to the [Data
  Age](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/campaigns/data-age.html). Data is today
  recognized as the single most important resource to contribute to economic
  growth in the next decade. And over the next 5 years we will have produced
  more data than the previous 5 000 years of humanity. The public and private
  sector has engaged in this development by sharing many valuable datasets. But

Data has become [the oil of the 21st century](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data). However, unlike oil, data is a renewable resource, and as long there are computers, data will keep flowing through the fibre pipes that constitute the Internet.

With the proliferation of low-cost sensoring equipment and better means to log data from even low-power devices (neatly coined IoT https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things), data is increasingly surrounding every aspect of our lives and will continue to do so in the next decade. According to IDC, over the next 5 years we will have produced as much data as the previous 30. The drivers behind this data boom is IoT and 5G technology. More than 50% of the data created in the world in the next decade will be created by IoT devices.
