title: How to share data in the IoT era
ingress: Welcome to the [Data
  Age](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/campaigns/data-age.html). Data is today
  recognized as the single most important resource to contribute to economic
  growth in the next decade. And over the next 5 years we will have produced
  more data than the previous 5 000 years of humanity. Don't believe me?  The
  public and private sector has engaged in this development by sharing many
  valuable datasets. But are todays methods for data sharing suitable for the
  future?

Data has become [the oil of the 21st century](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data). However, unlike oil, data is a renewable resource, and as long there are computers, data will keep flowing through the fibre pipes that constitute the Internet.

## Drivers

In the last 10 years, we have seen a surge of a plethora of devices connected to the Internet.  With the proliferation of low-cost sensoring equipment and better means to log data with higher frequency from even low-power devices (neatly coined [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)), data is increasingly surrounding every aspect of our lives and will continue to do so in the next decade. The world is becoming more and more interconnected - and our homes and [cities](https://cityxchange.eu/our-cities/) are becoming smart.\

When even your vacuum cleaner is generating [vast amounts of data](https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/9tgyrg/any_reason_why_my_xiaomi_robot_vacuum_uploads/), it's not hard to understand that over 50% of data created in the [world will be generated by IoT devices](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45213219), with an approximate of 40 billion internet connected devices. In addition to IoT, technologies such as 5G, Edge Computing and AI are also major contributors.
