title: How to share data in the IoT era
ingress: Data is today
  [recognized](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data)
  as the single most important resource to contribute to economic growth in the
  next decade. Connecting data in new ways creates new opportunities for
  innovation and new services. The public and private sector have engaged in
  this development by sharing many valuable datasets. But are todays methods for
  data sharing suitable for the future?

### The data economy

Data has become the oil of the 21st century. And over the next 5 years we will have produced more data than the previous 5 000 years of humanity. However, unlike oil, data is a renewable resource, and as long there are computers, data will keep flowing through the fibre pipes that constitute the Internet. Not convinced? Please take a look at how much data is generated [each minute](https://web-assets.domo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20-data-never-sleeps-8-final-01-Resize.jpg). 

With the increased amount of data flowing across devices and increased amount of data sources across public and private sectors, the value of data has gained political attention in the world.

For instance, the EU [says:](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/building-data-economy-brochure)

> Most economic activity will depend on data within a few years. The value of the European data economy for the 28 Member States is expected to grow from €377 billion in 2018 to €477 billion by 2020 and €1.054 billion by 2025

Similarly, other governments and political bodies recognize the importance of data as a source of innovation, new business models and improvement of existing digital services.\
\
Thus, with the increased amount of data, during the next 5 years we will witness a large ecosystem around both public and commercial data sources which will contribute to this economy. 

### How is data shared today?

Data today is mostly shared via web based APIs. Perhaps as a consequence of the famous Wogels quote that [APIs will rule the world](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2226610/amazon-cto-werner-vogels-says-apis-will-rule-the-world.html). Perhaps as a consequence of other uncontrolled factors in technological evolution. But the matter of fact is that APIs are the dominantly preferred medium/method for a data producer to share data with third party consumers.\
\
And the promise of APIs are many. Firstly, APIs are language independent. You can make APIs in almost every concievable programming language there is. And everyone can read from an API in any other language. It takes only a couple of lines of code to fetch something from an API. Secondly, APIs are platform independent. You can host APIs on premise, in the Cloud, on a Raspberry Pi, on your watch, you name it. As such, the ecosystem around APIs is enormous. REST based APIs have existed for a decade. And recently, we have seen the emergence of alternatives such as [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). And web based APIs exist for almost anything imaginable, including how to [brew beer](https://www.brewerydb.com/). So what is the problem with APIs when it comes to sharing data?

### Shortcomings

Let's assume you are an entity that wants to make your data available either as a completely public dataset, or a commercial dataset. We are in the year of 2025, where [50% of all data](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45213219) is produced on the fly by the 40 or so *billion* IoT devices. When even your vacuum cleaner is generating vast amounts of data *today*, it's not hard to understand that over 50% of data created in the world will be generated by IoT.
