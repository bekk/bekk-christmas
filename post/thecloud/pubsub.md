title: How clouds impact environment
ingress: >-
  We are generating staggering amounts of data each year. And the amount is
  ever-increasing year by year. IDC estimates that the amount of data worldwide
  will reach 175 zettabytes by 2025. Roughly half of it will be stored in public
  clouds and the rest in other types of data centers. What kind of impact does
  this have on the environment?

## Data is the new gold

In today's digital economy data has become the new gold. The more you have, the wealthier you are. And one of the benefits of data is that it is fairly versatile. Data can be information generated by us like photos, content we consume like streaming music, video, books and blogs, websites, newspapers. And it can be data gathered about us to predict our behavior - and subsequently used to understand and suggest what movies we might like, give us more appropriate ads and help presidents win elections, to mention only a few. Deloitte even has a bold statement;

>  By 2030, data collection and analysis will become the basis of all future service offerings and business models.

No wonder companies are fighting about the privilege to collect our data. 

## Data requires infrastructure

To be able to manage this vast sea of data requires some pretty heavy infrastructure. We often use the term cloud, but we are of course aware that we are talking about data centers.

The data centers powering the cloud have become as essential as water and electricity to the public. We depend on the cloud to keep our videos and photos safe. We buy shoes and other merchandise, and we communicate with our friends and family both near and far via the services build on the cloud. The data centers powering all the services we use in our day-to-day lives have silently but slowly become the backbone of the internet. They store, communicate, and transport the information we produce every single day. The more data we create, the more vital our data centers become.

The need to store all of our data has lead to a golden period of development in the data center industry, and the number of hyperscale datacenters in the world powering the cloud has experienced a 100% increase the last 5 years alone. Today there are over 500 hyperscale datacenters in the world, and many more are under development. And there is a total of 8 million datacenters worldwide.

It is hard to even imagine this number, but if one were able to store 175ZB onto BluRay discs, then you’d have a stack of discs that can get you to the moon 23 times and if you could download 175ZB on today’s largest hard drive, it would take 12.5 billion drives. 

This in turn has
