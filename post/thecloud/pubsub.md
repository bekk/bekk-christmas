title: How the clouds impact environment
ingress: >-
  We are generating staggering amounts of data each year. And the amount is
  ever-increasing year by year. IDC predicts that the amount of data worldwide
  will reach 175 zettabytes by 2025. Roughly half of it will be stored in public
  clouds and the rest in other types of data centers. What kind of impact does
  this have on the environment?

## Data is the new gold

It is hard to even imagine this number, but if one were able to store 175ZB onto BluRay discs, then you’d have a stack of discs that can get you to the moon 23 times and if you could download 175ZB on today’s largest hard drive, it would take 12.5 billion drives. Data has become the new gold. The more you have, the wealthier you are. And data is versatile. It can both be content generated by us like photos, it can be content we use like streaming music, video, books and blogs, webistes, newspapers. And it can be data gathered to predict our behavior - and subsequently used to understand and suggest what movies we might like, give us more appropriate ads and help presidents win elections. Deloitte even has a bold statement;

>  By 2030, data collection and analysis will become the basis of all future service offerings and business models.
