title: How the clouds impact environment
ingress: >-
  We are generating staggering amounts of data each year. And the amount is
  ever-increasing year by year. IDC predicts that the amount of data worldwide
  will reach 175 zettabytes by 2025. Roughly half of it will be stored in public
  clouds and the rest in other types of data centers. What kind of impact does
  this have on the environment?

# 175ZB

It is hard to even imagine this number, but if one were able to store 175ZB onto BluRay discs, then you’d have a stack of discs that can get you to the moon 23 times. “Even if you could download 175ZB on today’s largest hard drive, it would take 12.5 billion drives.”
