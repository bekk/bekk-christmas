  We are generating astounding amounts of data each year. Estimates show that
  the amount of data worldwide will reach 175 zettabytes by 2025. Roughly half
  of it will be stored in public clouds and the rest in other types of data
  centers. What kind of impact does this have on the environment? And is there
  anything you can do about it?

## Data is the new gold

In today's digital economy data has become the new gold. The more you have, the wealthier you are. And one of the benefits of data is that it is fairly versatile. Data can be information generated by us like photos, documents and emails, content we consume like streaming music, video, books and blogs, websites and newspapers. And it can be data gathered about us to predict our behavior - and subsequently used to understand and suggest what movies we might like, give us more appropriate ads and help presidents win elections, to mention only a few. Deloitte even has a bold statement;

>  By 2030, data collection and analysis will become the basis of all future service offerings and business models.

No wonder companies are fighting about the privilege to collect our data. 

## Data requires a massive infrastructure

To be able to manage and process this vast sea of data requires some pretty heavy infrastructure. We often use the term cloud, but we are of course aware that we are talking about huge data centers around the world covering millions of square meters of real estate which operate tens and hundreds of thousands of servers.

![test](/assets/tc-15-centres.jpg "Image of data center (Source: https://classmayte.wordpress.com/2016/02/06/what-is-data-center-what-are-the-top-5-largest-data-centers-around-the-world/)")

The data centers powering all the services we use in our day-to-day have become as essential as water and electricity to the public. They store, communicate, and transport the information we produce every single day. We depend on the cloud to keep our videos and photos safe. We depend on it at work to be able to send and receive email and collaborate on documents, code, schematics and share files. We use it to buy shoes and other merchandise online, and we communicate with our friends and family both near and far via the services build on the cloud.

The need to store all of our data together with the shift to cloud has lead to a golden period of development in the data center industry, and the number of hyperscale datacenters in the world powering the cloud has experienced a 100% increase the last 5 years alone. Today there are over [500 hyperscale datacenters in the world](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/cloud/analysts-there-are-now-more-500-hyperscale-data-centers-world), and 150 more are under development. And there is a total of [8 million datacenters 
worldwide](https://www.statista.com/statistics/500458/worldwide-datacenter-and-it-sites/).

## How much is 175ZB?

It is hard to even imagine this number, but if one were able to store 175ZB onto BluRay discs, then you’d have a stack of discs that can get you to the moon 23 times. If you could download 175ZB on a stack of hard disks, you would need approximately 11 billion drives (the largest hard drive in production as of writing is 16TB). Imagine the resources necessary to manufacture only the disk drives, and you will begin to realize that data center operations and implicitly the cloud employs a large industry. 

## What is the problem?

Building data centers has become an industry of its own right with an expected value of [$57 bn by 2025](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/future-of-data-centers/#storage). In addition to the actual housing of the data centers, you need to fill the data centers with lots and lots of hardware, hundreds of miles of cable, refrigerant and water for cooling, batteries and diesel generators to mitigate power outages, and last but not least - an enormous amount of energy to operate the hardware. I will present some issues with each of these.

**Hardware**

Since data centers require so much hardware, it is natural to assess the lifecycle impact of the hardware used in the data centers. For data center operations, hardware needs to be manufactured, shipped, installed, operated and decommissioned. Each of these processes requires resources. The manufacturing process for computer electronics for instance requires the mining and extraction of metal ore and in some instances rare earth metals such as neodymium which is used in traditional hard drives and terbium which is used in solid state electronics. Although rare earth metals is a somewhat [misleading term](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dont-panic-about-rare-earth-elements/), the extraction and processing of ore to produce concentrates usually involves usage of lots of heavy machinery and chemicals and leaves [significant impacts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227332044_Environmental_impact_assessment_of_open_pit_mining_in_Iran) on the environment via the open pits the mines [imprint on the geography](v). 

Hardware also usually has a fairly limited life span. Usually hardware is replaced every 3-5 years to keep up with performance requirements and reliability concerns for operations. [Decomissioning ](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3439917/how-to-decommission-a-data-center.html)hardware might entail both hazardous materials such as refrigerant used in cooling systems, electronic waste and recycling electronics. Especially recycling electronics will have a big impact on the life cycle assessment of the hardware. 

**Real estate**

Data centers require a lot of space. Hyperscale datacenters require hundreds of acres of land in order to accomodate the hardware. One of the issues are that cloud providers usually want data centers to be as close as possible to most end users, in order to provide best performance and lowest latency. This has lead to a competition for real estate between data centers and humans, and in Amsterdam, which houses 30% of all hyperscale data centers in Europe, it led to a [temporary ban on building new ones](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/regulation/why-amsterdam-halted-data-center-construction). 

**Energy**

Servers in data centers consume substantial amounts of energy. According to estimates from the International Energy Agency, data centers in the world account for [approximately 200 TWh/year energy consumption](https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-buildings/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks). This is approximately 1% of the total worldwide energy consumption. 1% might not sound like a big deal, but that is the equivalent of the [total energy consumption of Indonesia](https://www.worlddata.info/asia/indonesia/energy-consumption.php), a country of 250 million citizens and the 4th most populated country in the world. What is more important, the source of this energy might come from fossil fuels such as coal. If all this energy were produced by coal plants, it would result in an annual emission of [1.2 billion metrics tonnes of CO2](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Estimating_carbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_plants). In comparison, the total aviation industry emits roughly [0.9 billion metric tonnes of CO2](https://theicct.org/publications/co2-emissions-commercial-aviation-2018). Although many cloud providers have pledged to decarbonize their data centers, none have ditched fossil fuels entirely, and most of them rely on renewable energy credits rather than directly utilizing renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. Greenpeace has been [following up](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/greenpeace-finds-amazon-breaking-commitment-to-power-cloud-with-100-renewable-energy/) on the cloud providers pledges, and there are big differences, as laid out in [this recent](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-google-microsoft-green-clouds-and-hyperscale-data-centers/#) Wired article.

Some [alarmist predictions](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06610-y) indicate that the total energy consumption of data centers could rise to as much as 8% of total world energy consumption by 2030.

That's why environmental impact of the cloud is first and foremost dictated by the amount and source of its energy.

## Is there some light at the end of the tunnel?

Maybe

Although various sources report an increased energy consumption due to the increased demand for computation, and in particular an increased number of data centers, the International Energy Agency [refutes this](https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-buildings/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks), claiming the energy consumption will be stable for at least the next three years despite a projected 80% increase in data centre traffic and 50% increase in data centre workloads.

This needs some explanation. For the last 50 years, we have been able to cram an exponential number of transistors in a single processor. Mainly driven by manufacturing process improvements, reducing the size of each transistor has in addition to giving an exponential improvement in computing power, enabled a reduction in power consumption. So, even though we've seen a rapid increase in number of data centers, the technology improvement has been reducing power consumption by an equal amount. 

However, these efforts have lately come to a halt. We are getting close to physical boundaries with regards to how small each transistor can get before experiencing quantum effects, rendering computations non-deterministic. Therefore, instead of focusing on reducing transistor size, the processor industry has focused on providing the opportunity to increase the number of cores, and improve computation by parallelization.  Today, you can find processors with up to 64 cores, and GPUs with hundreds of cores, enabling parallellization of specific tasks. But not all computations are parallelizable, and this too will hit a rooftop in the future. 

Another driver behind this trend has been the data center industry itself. Energy is the single largest expense for a data center operation, and the industry has done quite some improvements.



Strong growth in demand for data centre services continues to be offset by continued improvements in the efficiency of servers, storage devices, network switches and data centre infrastructure, as well as a shift to much greater shares of cloud and hyperscale data centres. Hyperscale data centres are very efficient, large-scale cloud data centres that run at high capacity, owing in part to virtualisation software that enables data centre operators to deliver higher work output with fewer servers.

The shift away from small, inefficient data centres towards much larger cloud and hyperscale data centres is evident in the shrinking share of data centre infrastructure in total energy demand, given the very low power usage effectiveness (PUE) of large data centres. PUE is a measure of how efficiently a data centre uses energy; the very best hyperscale data centres can have PUE values of around 1.1 (meaning 0.1 kWh used for cooling/power provision for every 1 kWh used for IT equipment).

Over the past 10 years, data center power usage effectiveness (PUE) -- the ratio of total power required to run an entire facility versus the direct power involved in compute and storage -- has decreased. Google now maintains an impressive PUE of 1.12 across all of its data centers, including all sources of overhead, which is very close to the theoretically perfect PUE of 1.0.



However, now that PUEs have improved, the low-hanging fruit is gone. Future efficiency gains will be minor and incremental

The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimated that if 80 percent of servers in the U.S. were moved over to optimized hyperscale facilities, this would result in a 25 percent drop in their energy usage.

But the biggest signal, says Fox, will come from us, the digital consumers. Increasingly, he says, “they understand that every cloud lives inside a data center. And each has a different footprint.” We will, he believes, soon all demand to know the carbon footprint of our video streams and internet searches. The more far-sighted of the big data companies are gearing up for that day. “I fully expect we may see green labelling for digital sources as routine within five years.” 

Data center energy consumption first came under heavy scrutiny in the early 2000s, when experts warned that the rapid growth of the Internet would drive a rise in worldwide fossil fuel emissions. Thankfully, energy efficiency improvements and innovation in renewable energy has substantially lowered the increase of the industry’s power consumption – despite the fact that the hunger for data has accelerated.

Furthermore, improved hardware efficiency, server virtualization and the advent of hyper-scale data centers, has driven economies of scale for the likes of Microsoft and Amazon. These IT behemoths have mastered the art of maximizing data center efficiency and server utilization, as well as improving their power systems and cooling equipment.

 Consequently,

smaller data centers are still being measured with PUE values greater than 2.037 while large

hyperscale cloud data centers are beginning to record PUE value of 1.1 or less.38 39 40

## Why is this important and what is there to be done?

Resistance to both the cloud and the Borg is futile. Limiting viral videos, Google searches and users from using online services is obviously to no purpose, even if research shows that 4K pictures alone can 

However, for us in the industry of making such services, there lies a responsibility to inform and acquaint our bosses, customers 

As a part of this advent calendar, our CTO wrote an article about private PaaS [being considered harmful](https://thecloud.christmas/2019/2). He was mainly arguing the benefits of public clouds versus private clouds and data centers. I hope this article has contributed to illuminate a new perspective. Not only are private clouds considered harmful from an innovation perspective, but from an environmental aspect as well, where hyperscale clouds continue to innovate not only on the breath of services, but also on energy efficiency on a scale. \

Despite energy efficiency 

What I am optimistic about is the opportunity for major compute efficiency improvements. Disruptive innovation on the compute side will inevitably come to market soon, giving us faster compute engines and architectures that deliver more computational density per watt. We are currently stuck with architectures developed some 40 years ago that are not going to satisfy humanity’s insatiable thirst for a lot more processing, much faster processing and much more energy-efficient processing.

I believe compute efficiency innovation is on the verge of happening. In the face of such a strong market pull, it is inevitable. Frankly, the only thing left to improve is the compute side of the equation. We have already improved everything around compute architecture, and further improvements outside compute are now contributing only small and incremental improvements to overall data center efficiency and performance.

Why am I optimistic? Forty years ago, when today’s ubiquitous processors were designed, transistors were infinitely slow compared to wires. Forty years later, with transistor and wire trace widths shrunk down to an astounding 7nm (human DNA is 2.5nm wide), transistors are much faster than the wires that connect them. This represents a complete reversal of the delay characteristics of the two fundamental components (transistors and wires) of every chip ever built. Yet we still build and use processors designed when things were completely reversed from how they are today. How can that possibly lead to an optimal design at 7nm transistor sizes? It can’t, and that’s the reason I’m optimistic that we are on verge of major breakthroughs in compute architecture.

It’s either a breakthrough in our compute engines, or we need to get deadly serious about doubling the number of power plants on the planet.
