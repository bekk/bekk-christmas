To complete the steps in this article you need the following tools installed on your computer:

* A google cloud project with where you are the owner
* The [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts) command line tools
* [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) command line tools
* [Helm 3](https://github.com/helm/helm) installed
* NodeJS (optional) if you want to run the application locally

You also need to enable the Kubernetes engine and Container Registry apis in GCP. The code used in this article can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/espenmeidell/christmas-19). 

## What is Helm?

Helm describes itself as the package manager for Kubernetes. By creating Helm charts, we can describe all the required parts of our application, such as deployments, configmaps, and services, in one place. Helm uses value files that can inject variables into the templates. This makes it easy to customize deployments across different environments.  

...TODO

## The Sample Application

To keep things as simple as possible we will deploy a simple web server that listens for requests and replies with a christmasy message. The app is written in NodeJS and creates an Express web server. 

package.json:
```json
{
  "name": "hello-christmas",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "morgan": "^1.9.1"
  }
}
```
index.js:
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const morgan = require("morgan");

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 8000;

app.use(morgan("combined"));

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Christmas is coming ðŸŽ…");
});

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Christmas is comping on ${port}!`));

```
Dockerfile
```
FROM node:12.7.0-alpine

WORKDIR '/app'

COPY . .

RUN npm install
EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```
To test the app locally run `npm install` and `node index.js`. You should now see  the app running by visiting [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser. 

The next step is to build the docker image and push it to a container registry. We'll tag the first version of our app with `1`:

```
docker build . -t eu.gcr.io/[GCP-PROJECT-NAME]/app:1
docker push eu.gcr.io/[GCP-PROJECT-NAME]/app:1
```

Once these commands have finished you should be able to visit [the container registry](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/) and see the image there.  


## The Kubernetes Cluster

Now that we have published the image to the registry, we need a place to run our application. To achieve this, we will create a Kubernetes cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine. 
``
gcloud container clusters create santas-workshop 
``

It will take a few minutes before the cluster is ready, so go grab some eggnog while the servers are spinning up.


Now that the cluster is ready, and we have pushed our deployable app to the container registry, we need to describe our deployment. This is where Helm comes in. 

## Creating the Helm Chart

To create a new chart run the following command (christmas-app is the name of the chart we want to deploy):
``
helm create christmas-app
``

This will create a new folder with the name `christmas-app` containing some files:

* Chart.yaml: Metadata about our application
* values.yaml: Variables for our application
* templates/deployment.yaml: Kubernetes deployment file
* templates/service.yaml: Kubernetes service file

It will also create some other files, but for this article we will stick to a simple deployment with one service. Values are added to the files using the [Helm Templating Language](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_template_guide/). A Helm chart can have multiple value files. This makes it simple to manage different configurations for different environments.

We need to edit some of the files before we can deploy our app. We will start by setting `appVersion` and `version` in `Chart.yaml` to `1`. 

The next step is to update the `values.yaml` file. Set `image.repository` to `eu.gcr.io/[GCP-PROJECT-NAME]/app`. The `appVersion` from [`Chart.yaml`](https://github.com/espenmeidell/christmas-19/blob/de47b44354e22ef9f412fbcb8dab5ae0901c6eb2/christmas-app/templates/deployment.yaml#L28) will be used as the docker image tag.

Our docker image exposes port 8000, so we need to update the container health checks in `deployment.yaml` accordingly:

```yaml
...
      containers:
        - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
          securityContext:
            {{- toYaml .Values.securityContext | nindent 12 }}
          image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Chart.AppVersion }}"
          imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.image.pullPolicy }}
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8000
              protocol: TCP
...
```

Now that weâ€™ve specified what docker image to use for our deployment, letâ€™s package it up and try to deploy it. First weâ€™ll run the linter:
```
helm lint christmas-app
```

If there are no errors we can package our deployment. This will create a compressed and versioned archive that represents our entire deployment. Neat!
```
helm package christmas-app
```

To list the configurable values and their current value you can run:
```
helm show values christmas-app-1.tgz
```

Now we install our application on the cluster. `christmasapp` is the name of the release of our app.
``` 
helm install christmasapp christmas-app-1.tgz
```
We can use the kubectl tool to check the status of how the deployment is going:
```
kubectl get pods
```
Once the pod is in the running state, letâ€™s check the logs: 
```
kubectl logs <pod name>
```

You should see the log messages created by our web server. Great! But it is a web server, so we want to be able to connect to it. The astute reader may have noticed that we didnâ€™t create a service with a public IP address. This can be confirmed by running:
```
kubectl get svc
```

Helm is nice enough to give us the command to enable port forwarding from our local machine: 
```
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=christmas-app,app.kubernetes.io/instance=christmasapp" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:8000
```
Now we can visit http://localhost:8080/ and see that our app is running. Obviously we donâ€™t want to use port forwarding to access our app, so we will need to update our chart. 


## Adding a Load Balancer

First we edit `values.yaml` and set the service type to a load balancer. 
```yaml
...
service:
  type: LoadBalancer
  port: 80
  targetPort: 8000
...
```
We also need to change the file describing the service (`service.yaml`) by adding the target port:
```yaml
...
spec:
  type: {{ .Values.service.type }}
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
      targetPort: {{ .Values.service.targetPort }}
...
```
Finally, we bump the version number in `Chart.yaml` to 2:
```yaml
...
version: 2
...
```

Now that the templates have been added we can package it up. This will create a new file with the name `christmas-app-2.tgz`:
```
helm package christmas-app
```

Now it's time to roll out the new release. To do this we use the `helm upgrade` command. Note that to most Helm commands we can add the `--dry-run` flag to see what changes the command will create.

```
helm upgrade christmasapp christmas-app-2.tgz
```

We have to wait for a bit until the load balancer gets an IP address. We can watch it happen with:
```
kubectl get svc -w
```

Once a value appears under `EXTERNAL-IP`, copy it and open it in the browser. You should see the message from our server!


## Updating the Application

Letâ€™s say we want to release a new version of our app that counts down the days until Christmas. We update the javascript file, build and push a new docker image:
```
docker build . -t eu.gcr.io/julekalender/app:2
docker push eu.gcr.io/julekalender/app:2
```

We have tagged the image with 2, so we update the appVersion in Chart.yaml. We also need to update the chart version to 3. Note the difference between the application version and chart version. Then we package the new release:
```
helm package christmasapp
helm upgrade christmasapp christmas-app-3.tgz
```

Helm will detect the changes and create a new pod with the updated app. When the new version is ready it will shut down the old pod. This way there is no downtime for our mission critical Christmas app!

If you visit the IP you should see the updated app.

## Release History and Rollback

The following command allows us to see the release history of our application:
```
helm history christmasapp
```

If we want to undo the latest change, rolling back to the previous revision is as simple as:
```
helm rollback christmasapp 0
```

Soon we will see the previous version of the app. By checking the history, we can see that the rollback is added as a new release. This way we have full control over our release history.
