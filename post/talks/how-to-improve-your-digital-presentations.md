My advice would be to try to stick to as normal procedure as possible, and in some way try to
forget that the situation we are in, and that it is different from what we all want it to be.

First of all, most of us are at this point pretty tired of technical issues of various kinds, we are also
fed up with joking about it, so why not try to to minimize the effects that these have on the points
you want to get through?
If you have issues with the camera or the sound, try discretely to fix it without drawing too much
attention to it. We are more than used to this now. If it takes way too much time, you could consider
adding a small comment, but try to tone it down.

What can you do to make it easier for yourself to hold the presentation?
As many may have noticed, the lack of feedback you inevitably get from the audience when they are actually
present with you, can be a bit off-putting.

Some platforms, like Zoom and Teams, have the functionality to choose a sequence of participants to focus on.
Just as you would in a more classic talk, you can choose to watch more closely those who seems to paying the most
attention, and have a vivid body language.

What do you do if you spot someone in your (maybe even preselected) audience who seems to drop their attention,
or maybe even yawn or looking at their phone? Just as in a live setting there is really little you can do about it,
other than trying to ignore it (and then focuse on someone with more orderly digital manners), and try to
push through as unaffected as possible.

Another tip would be to dress and act just as you would in the hopefully more normal setting we eventually will
return to. To run your talk while standing should also be as natural as it would be in a live setting.

Also try to remove any background noise, both visually and audially, from your talk. While it still is somewhat cute with
animals, plants, santa clauses or home-made snowmen in the background of your surroundings, this is probably still best in
more familiar settings with your closer collegaues. Try to keep it a bit more professional and avoid needless distractions
where you can.

Your slides may have to be altered a bit from a regular talk. Keeping slides clean is always a virtue - with the smaller screens
that is most often used by the participants in a digital setting - one must focus even a bit more to keep headlines and text
visual enough so the audience will be able to read it with as little effort as possible.

Good luck in honing your presentation skills even digitally!
