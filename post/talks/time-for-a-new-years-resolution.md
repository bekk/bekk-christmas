  Thank you for joining our calendar this December. We truly hope you have
  gotten inspired by our reflections, ideas and learnings. Now, it's Christmas
  Eve, and the story of Cinderella will soon reveal itself once again. Relax. 


  During December, we hope to have given you a tiny spark in the back of your head. Share more with others, try presenting more, in the year to come. We promise you that it will be worth it!

And if you are afraid of presenting, know that almost every man or woman is! If you're not sure, rewind and take a stroll down memory lane and look back at our own experiences and reflections on stage fright and how you can cope with it in any of these hatches\
