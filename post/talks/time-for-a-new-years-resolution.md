ingress: Thank you for joining our calendar this December. We truly hope you
  have gotten inspired by our reflections, ideas and learnings. Now, it's
  Christmas Eve, and the story of Cinderella will soon reveal itself once again.
  Relax. But, we hope to have given you a tiny tiny spark in the back of your
  head. *Share more with others, try presenting more, in the year to come*. We
  promise you that it will be worth it!

And if you are afraid of presenting, know that almost every man or woman is! If you're not sure, rewind and take a stroll down memory lane and look back at our own experiences and reflections from all of these hatches [2](https://www.talks.christmas/2020/2), [3](https://www.talks.christmas/2020/3), [9](https://www.talks.christmas/2020/9), [10](https://www.talks.christmas/2020/10), [11](https://www.talks.christmas/2020/11), [20](https://www.talks.christmas/2020/20), [21](https://www.talks.christmas/2020/21), or just enjoy the laughs from the old classic from Don McMillan *"Life After Death by PowerPoint"*;
