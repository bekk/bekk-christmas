ingress: Mondays. Mondays may be the time for contemplation and relaxation after
  this weeks very first working day. However, Mondays may also be a good time to
  find your favourite position in the sofa, lean back and learn talk skills from
  others presenting. This blog post introduces talk analysis as a tool to be a
  become a better presenter yourself.

### Talk analysis

Without even thinking about it, we are always continuously analysing when others are presenting to us. And when we present ourselves, we often tend to be our own greatest critics. However, in the group in Bekk behind this calendar, that focuses on presentation and dissemination, we have found that a more structured approach to talk analysis comes in handy when learning the best ways to present. 

### Structure the learning

Not much is needed in order to structure (and enhance) the analysis of a particular talk. For example, it may be as simple as writing down a sentence or two afterwards Some different examples:

- What was the main thing you learned? What was it that the person did that made you remember exactly that lesson so well?
- Underway in the presentation, write down 2 things that was particularly good, and 2 things that can be improved.

You may also take notes during the presentation along various dimensions:

**Body Language** - How did the presenter use his/hers body language? Did it have something to say in terms of your learning?
**Pitch of voice** - How did the presenter utilize his/hers tone/pitch of voice?
**Speaker's style** - Does this specific presenter have a particular style? What is your style?
**Remedies** - Do the person use a physical object to underpin his/hers arguments? Are they using the audience actively?

### Analysis of each others

There is a lot of different kind of talks you can analyse! You may analyse the next american inaguration speech in January, a lightening talk at the next Javazone, or even a presentation in your team. In Bekk's competency group for talks, we have found it useful to lower the bar and give each other feedbacks, and provide your own analysis after you have listened to your colleagues present. Focus on what the person did well, and give a pointer towards what the person can focus on in the next presentation. Just remember to ask first if it's OK that you give your feedback.

### Try it out for yourselves!

If you have some left over time during this monday, find a talk/presentation/speech that you remember as great, and perform a short and sweet analysis of your own. It's quite fun! If something doesn't comes to mind, you can find links to good sites for talks below.

And who know, maybe we posts some of your analysis during December? ðŸŽ…
