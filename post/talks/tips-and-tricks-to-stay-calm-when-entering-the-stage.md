## Stage freight and the history of the human species

In yesterdays hatch in this calendar, we learned how [stage freight can be explained by the history of humans](https://www.talks.christmas/2020/9) and we got to know more about the evolutionary aspect on why stepping on to a scene to present in front of other people can make our whole system to ring the alarm bell and telling us that this is something dangerous.

## What can you do to handle stage freight?

To help you with what you can do yourself to handle the situation when stepping on to a scene (or pressing the button to share your screen in a video meeting) we have collected some tips and tricks that hopefully can help you prepare so you can stay calm when presenting.
