ingress: When creating a presentation it's good to have your own style, adding
  your own touch. Over the years creating different presentations for
  conferences or for a demo, I have developed my own approach when creating
  presentation slides. I want to present it for you, and I hope you like it!

There are several ways to design your slides when creating a presentation. I.e do you have a content-rich slides and few pages, or do you have 40 views for a 5 minute talk? The last one is me. I prefer to create slides with minimal texts, a lot of images or illustrations, and where I have to press the Enter button several times a minute. 

Disclaimer: This is my point of view. I'm not saying that other ways of creating presentations is wrong, but rather they way I prefer when making my presentations.

## Remove the wall-of-text

It is hard to remember everything you need to say in a long presentation is hard, especially if there are an in-depth talk and you need to have all your facts right. However, I feel when I'm having a lot of text on my slides, I lose the connection with the audience. The listeners will focus on the slide and read the text simultaneously listening of what you are saying. It is also easier to throw myself off guard if I forgot to say something in the chunk of text, because the audience will see if I forget a specific part.

I have found it liberating to shorten the text on my slides to the minimum. Short sentences, bullet list, even only single words sometimes. Choose the most important words to present to the listeners, even use them as reminder of what you are going to tell. This way if you forget some of the sentences, maybe it wasn't an important part of your speech. 

## Use informative pictures and illustrations

I find it more successful to use pictures or illustration in my presentation to catch the attention of the listeners. I often try to find screenshots, pictures or even gifs to illustrate the things I want to explain (you can easily make a gif from a video you record ðŸ¤“). Sometimes I dedicate an entire page of my presentation for an emoji, as long as it makes sense of what I'm going to say. 

You want to show your working method in your team? Take a picture of the post-its. You want to show the structure of your code, add arrows or colors or animations. 

By adding these "creative" slides, I think it will capture the listeners attention. At least I will pay a close attention.

## Multiple slides and frequent switches

So we have gotten rid of the text-heavy pages, and added the informative pictures to our slides instead. How are we now suppose to remember all we want to say? 

I'm using each change of slide as a reminder of the things I'm going to say. If there is a part that I keep forgetting to mention when I'm practicing, I add a new page for that specific part that reminds me of it. It's almost (with a little exaggeration) that for every new sentence, I go to the next slide.

Often I want to present as little information as possible to the user, I only present the information I want they to focus on. For instance when showing a code snippet I start with the part I'm talking about, and keep adding the next part and next one, etc. The attention span for most people is short, always keep them wanting more!

## Disadvantages

As I said in the introduction, this is a way I have discovered along the way of creating presentations. It doesn't suit everyone. First of all, you need to use a lot of time creating the slides. Adjust what text and what you want to illustrate require some tweaking. You are also rely on that you are close to your computer or a "clicker" for being able to change slides often, preventing you from running across the stage every time you need to show a new slide. Finally, it requires that you have time to practice on your presentation multiple times to know where you need to add a slide or two, therefore if you are a spontaneous person this may not be the way for you. 

## VoilÃ !

We have talked about removing the wall of text, enriching the slides with illustrations and pictures, and using every slide change as a reminder of what you are going to talk about next. This is the way I am creating textless presentations, which are helping me become more free of my presentation notes. 

This was a little introduction to how I make my presentations. Hope you liked it!
