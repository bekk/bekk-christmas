ingress: When creating a presentation it's good to have your own style, having
  your own touch. Over the years creating different presentations for
  conferences or for demo, I have developed my own approach when creating
  presentation slides. I want to present this for you, and I hope you like it!

There are several ways to design your slides when creating a presentation. I.e do you have a lot of content on each slide and few pages, or do you have 40 views for a 5 minute talk? The last one is me. I prefer to create slides with minimal texts, a lot of images or illustrations, and where I have to press the Enter button several times a minute.
