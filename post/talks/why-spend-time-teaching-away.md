We often admire the people that are great speakers. It seems to be low effort for them, and often so so difficult when we, the mortals, try the same. However, there are many good reasons for why you should teach away to others. Let's have a look!

### 1. You better understand what you are teaching away

To me, this has been a real eye-opener! By teaching others, you actually learn *a lot* yourself. By thinking about how you should deliver the message to an audience, you also need to really understand the problem well, and create a clear solution to it. By connecting these dots before you teach others, you are left with a much better understanding. 

### 2. You help others

Even though experienced speakers seemingly rock, it might not be enough for everyone to understand a topic. But you, oh you, with your personal experiences about the subject and different way of presenting than the natural talent, might hit just the right (learning) spot for someone in the audience. When you recognize an understanding between you and a listener in the audience, it really feels like you are given a gift.

### 3. Becoming a better listener

By gaining experience through holding talks to others, you become much more aware when you are listening to others - maybe the boring parts rather become more interesting, as you become interested in how it can be boring, and how you can make the boring parts interesting? Interesting.

### 4. You will always need talk-like skills

You will always need talk-like skills to cope with everyday situations, such as wedding speeches, deliver a memorial speech at a funeral, or in your childrens confirmation. Why not start now?
