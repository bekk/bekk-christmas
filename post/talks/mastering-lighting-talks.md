You have probably seen one, either digitally or live. Short and succinct presentations with a carefully crafted message, accompanied by a set number of slides shown for a limited time. Presenters pacing their speech to line up perfectly as the next slide appears. 

Lightning-talks are just like regular talks. On steroids. Ripe with constraints, mastering lightning-talks requires focus and keeping out distractions. They should spark curiosity and even a sense of wonder and interest. Leaving your audience eager to find out more about this in their own. 

## Stay clear of the woods

Time is an obvious factor when it comes to lightning-talks, which means you will have to skip the deep dive into the nitty-gritty of things. That is not to say that lightning-talks should be superficial. The presentation should still be substantive and worthy of the audiences time.

## Single-idea-presentations

Limit yourself to a single idea or concept that you want to discuss and share with the audience. This will allow you to fully form a coherent argument about why this is important and engage your audience. 

Sticking to a single idea or concept will make it easier to get to the point early on in your talk. Present your idea or concept, providing just enough background or context so that the audience will be able to follow you on your journey. The audience does not need to become experts on the topic, the allotted time does not allow for that. 

> This talk is about \[insert topic here], and how this will make the world a better place for \[us/them/everyone]

## Designing the presentation

Filling the slides with text never a good idea, and even more so when it comes to lighting talks. The last thing you want is to have your audience reaching half-way down the slide before it changes automatically. Use text sparingly and always with purpose. 

Some events will require you to have slides change automatic after a given number of seconds. Prepare for it and use it to your advantage. When designing your slide-deck, and in particular if you are using timed slide changes, the slides should allow for smooth transitions of your talk. Meaning that you should not be forced to stop talking mid-sentence because the slide changed. 

## On delivering the presentation

Beware of the temptation to speed-talk. This is particularly true if you are still talking about the point made on the previous slide. If you start upping your pace, the audience will start stressing with you. Suddenly the audiences attention shifts from your message and to whether or not you will be able to get through everything before the next slide.

While it is tempting to think that “it’s *just* 6/8/12 minutes”, rehearsing your lightning-talk is key. Tuning your message and presentation to a perfect fit. The beauty of having only a short amount of time is that you can rehearse several times. 

Above all, enjoy the experience! The audience is rooting for you and are on your side.
