title: The power of your voice
ingress: So, you’ve conquered your fear of taking the stage, you’ve prepared
  your presentations to perfection, and things are going well. But it still
  feels like your delivery is lacking something, and the audience all seem a bit
  careless. I think it’s time to introduce the real power of your voice.
