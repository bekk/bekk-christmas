The good, the bad and the hideous: experiments with visual presentation styles
Remember the Global Surveillance Disclosures from Edward Snowden in June 2013? Of course. We all remember that faithful day when the world become a slightly more scary place, but also a bit more illuminated. What you might not remember, is the the widely publicized slide deck that the Guardian dubbed “(Prism: the PowerPoint presentation so ugly it was meant to stay secret)[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/jun/12/prism-nsa-powerpoint-graphic-design].”

Well, I’ve been on my own journey of trial and error on how slides should look in order to captivate, entertain and, not least, inform the audience. Without the dubious joy of a TOP SECRET classification to protect me from prying eyes. As I divulged in my (previous pre-holiday musings)[https://www.talks.christmas/2020/11], experimentation has been a central theme for me when learning to embrace public speaking. So, let's have a look!

We've all been there! Standard template in Powerpoint, bulletpoints galore. Maybe even, for good  measure, throw in some simple animations.

Obviously, it's not the most visually pleasing. But it gets the job done. It makes it easier for people to follow what you're saying, as there are pegs to help them focus their attention on the most important points you're making.

I often start with something like this to structure my thoughts and to get past the "OMG, I have NO idea how I'm gonna get this done" phase. But I _very_ rarely end up with something looking like this.

## The slightly less simple
