## 1. Crafting the perfect pull-request

A well-crafted pull-request will save everyone's time by being to-the-point and does what it says on the tin.

Think about its size, how you can break it up into smaller pieces and spend time on a precise title and fitting description.

## 2. Writing good issues

Give everyone the context and understanding of the problem you've identified. Put yourself in their shoes: how can someone on the outside understand what you're seeing, and what information is neccessary to give? If you have a suggested solution, be concrete and ready with examples and explainations.

## 3. Using saved replies

I just learned about this one myself and I'm already loving it! Stop writing the same replies over and over again on GitHub. Instead, write them once and save them for later. Next time you want to reply with a pre-saved reply, simply select a pre-written reply! üòÅ

_Tip: Use "LGTM" (Looks good to me) with lots of emojis as your first reply üòâ_
