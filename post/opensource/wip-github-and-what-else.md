## GitHub

First and foremost, how about some Github history. Started in 2008 as [Logical Awesome LLC](http://logicalawesome.com), it changed its name to [GitHub in 2010](https://github.blog/2010-01-22-new-year-new-company/). 

It also saw a huge milestone in July that same year, when it reached [one million repositories created](https://github.blog/2010-07-25-one-million-repositories/). Github was bought by Microsoft in June 2018 for $7.5 billion, a highly discussed topic that [not all Github users were happy about](https://twitter.com/hashtag/movingtogitlab). Today, Github has more than 40 million users in total, with [44 million repositories created in just the last year](https://octoverse.github.com)

All in all, GitHub has a pretty big share of the market. But it does have some great competitors. Let's take a look at a few alternatives to GitHub.

## "The others"

Let's start with Bitbucket.

### Bitbucket

[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) has seen a lot of success over the last couple of years, just this year it announced [10 million Bitbucket Cloud users](https://bitbucket.org/blog/celebrating-10-million-bitbucket-cloud-registered-users). It started as a start-up back in 2008, and was aquired by Atlassian in 2010. 

In the beginning, it only offered support for [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) projects, but rolled out Git support in 2011. Some of the really convenient features it boasts are its integrations with other Atlassian products. To support the whole product team and the development process, one can use Jira, Trello and Confluence together and have an impressing amount of features supporting the development.

Both Github and Bitbucket are proprietary software. 

### GitLab

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com) on the other hand, is a product that both enables open source, and truly embodies its essence. [The first commit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/commit/9ba1224867665844b117fa037e1465bb706b3685) was made by its founder Dmitriy back in 2011, in a house in Ukraine without running water. GitLab Enterprise Edition launched in 2013 and by 2016 it had over 1000 contributers to the source code. 

The story of GitLab's origins to where it is today is a great success-story for open source. Hosted on its own platform, the [code base](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) is still open source and its GitLab Community Edition is distributed under the [MIT Expat license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
