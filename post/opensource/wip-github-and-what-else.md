## Brief history of GitHub

First and foremost, how about some Github history. Started in 2008 as [Logical Awesome LLC](http://logicalawesome.com), it changed its name to [GitHub in 2010](https://github.blog/2010-01-22-new-year-new-company/). 

It also saw a huge milestone in July that same year, when it reached [one million repositories created](https://github.blog/2010-07-25-one-million-repositories/). Github was bought by Microsoft in June 2018 for $7.5 billion, a highly discussed topic that [not all Github users were happy about](https://twitter.com/hashtag/movingtogitlab). Today, Github has more than 40 million users in total, with [44 million repositories created in just the last year](https://octoverse.github.com)

All in all, GitHub has a pretty big share of the market. But it does have some great competitors. 

## "The others"

Let's start with Bitbucket:

### Bitbucket

[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) has seen a lot of success over the last couple of years, just this year it announced [10 million Bitbucket Cloud users](https://bitbucket.org/blog/celebrating-10-million-bitbucket-cloud-registered-users). It started as a start-up back in 2008, and was aquired by Atlassian in 2010. 

In the beginning, it only offered support for [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) projects, but rolled out Git support in 2011. Some of the really convenient features it boasts are its integrations with other Atlassian products, such as Jira.

Both Github and Bitbucket are proprietary software. 

### GitLab

[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) on the other hand, is a product that both enables Open source, and embodies its essence. Hosted on its own platform, the code base [is Open source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab), and its Gitlab Community Edition is distributed under the (MIT Expat license)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License].
