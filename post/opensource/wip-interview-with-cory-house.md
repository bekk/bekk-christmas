The questions below came from a simple question we asked ourselves: 

> if you had the chance, what would you ask an Open source maintainer/person/community member.

Here we go!

## What are your biggest challenges in working with Open source today and how do you handle them?

Lack of sufficient examples. Some docs only show a simple example. Some mention settings and options, but don't clearly show them in context. As a maintainer, it's challenging to get a lot of pull requests. They're very time consuming to review, and often contain significant changes so it's hard to tell the implications quickly.

## Are there any useful tools you use to make your GitHub-life easier to manage, and if so, could you share a few of them with us?

I enjoy GitLens. The VSCode plugin is handy.  

## How can repository-owners facilitate contributions from newcomers in Open source?

Populate a comprehensive PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file. Tell people how to run the app, run the tests, coding standards, etc. Document a clear path toward getting code accepted.  

## If you could time-travel to when you first started, what advice would you give yourself as an Open source rookie?

Build a solid network of people you trust by attending conferences and getting involved on social media. Use this network to vet your ideas. 

## Can you describe how you see the future of Open source, what new directions or paths do you think it will take?

I hope to see more comprehensive, crowd sourced examples. This StackOverflow, but for providing many examples for a given technology.

Thanks for taking the time to talk with us Cory! ðŸ’ª
