The questions below came from a simple question we asked ourselves: 

> if you had the chance, what would you ask an Open source maintainer/person/community member?

Here we go!

## What are your biggest challenges in working with Open source today and how do you handle them?

Even though I find Open Source better than closed source in numerous ways, still Security remains a challenge, since the code is all out there. Moreover, these days, as Open Source has become a very hot topic, the number of contributors has increased significantly. As a dark side of it, low-standard code contributions has increased largely. 

We need to define contributors guidelines better and can also consider adding a â€˜peer-reviewâ€™ step to the process.

## How can repository-owners facilitate contributions from newcomers in Open source?

Newcomers to Open Source have a different energy and willingness to learn and do stuff that the long-time contributors generally donâ€™t have. I remember when my first PR got merged, I was so happy that I kept dancing for an hour after that.

The repository-owners can encourage more newcomers to contribute to their projects by making some beginner-friendly issues, having a simple contributing,md file, being active mentors on the IRC, Slack, etc. The newcomers can give you directions about user-friendliness, like how difficult was it to run/use the code in the first time, what can be documented well, finding broken links/obsolete documentation, etc. 

The point of view of an inexperienced developer is equally important as that of a senior one.

## If you could time-travel to when you first started, what advice would you give yourself as an Open source rookie?

I made this very common mistake of not asking questions at the communication channels of the organisations. This left me spending long hours understanding very tiny features of the codebase. Iâ€™d strongly advise my younger self to go ahead and ask questions, as the mentors/code maintainers are there to help and they would honestly be happy to help you.

## Can you describe how you see the future of Open source, what new directions or paths do you think it will take?

Open Source is here to stay. I believe the inclination towards Open Source that weâ€™re getting to see these days, among businesses is going to grow in the future. Itâ€™s cost-effective and it fosters growth, which is all that companies want.

Thanks for taking the time to talk with us Saloni! ðŸ’ª
