The questions below came from a simple question we asked ourselves: 

> if you had the chance, what would you ask an Open source maintainer/person/community member.

Here we go!

## What are your biggest challenges in working with Open source today and how do you handle them?

## Are there any useful tools you use to make your GitHub-life easier to manage, and if so, could you share a few of them with us?

## How can repository-owners facilitate contributions from newcomers in Open source?

## If you could time-travel to when you first started, what advice would you give yourself as an Open source rookie?

## Can you describe how you see the future of Open source, what new directions or paths do you think it will take?

Thanks for taking the time to talk with us Mikael! ðŸ’ª
