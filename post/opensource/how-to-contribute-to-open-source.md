  For a lot of developers, the thought of putting your code or ideas out there
  for the whole community to see, can be daunting. Once you get the hang of it
  and get more comfortable though, it has a tendency to drag you in. We think
  Open Source is such an important part of a developer’s life that we’ve devoted
  an entire advent calendar to the subject! Let's start by going through your
  first steps towards your first contribution.
