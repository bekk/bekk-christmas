title: Why should you open source your product?

Opening up your code base for everyone to see can be a bit scary. Everyone can see your (bad) code and commit messages, it's easier for evil people to find weaknesses or make fake copies of your product. But there are many good reasons for open-sourcing a project. Even if it's not a library, framework or other developer-facing tool. Let's go through some of them.

## You seek contributions from the community
This is maybe the most obvious reason. If your code is open sourced, outsiders can contribute to the development of the project. This is a strong argument for libraries, frameworks and tools where the target user group is developers.

## Transparency
One reason for open sourcing your code is to achieve _transparency_. You might want – or are required to – give people the possibility to read the code. This is a common argument for public companies, where the tax payers should be able to have insight into what is made, and therefore, what they pay for. [NAV](https://github.com/navikt), [Digipost](https://github.com/digipost) and [Entur](https://github.com/entur) are examples of Norwegian public companies that have taken this principle to heart.

## Showcase for other technology
If you are a data or API provider or creator of a framework or library, you can create open source projects that work as a _showcase_ for your main product. This shows both what is possible to do with your APIs/data/library and developers can see how to do it.

[Norgeskart](https://norgeskart.no) is an interactive map of Norway created by Kartverket (The Norwegian Mapping Authority). It's on [GitHub](https://github.com/kartverket/norgeskart3). I asked Kartverket why they open sourced this project, and Senior Engineer Håvard Vidme at Kartverket could tell me: "Norgeskart is our so-called 'showcase' where we show some of what we have. If someone wants to create their own map client with or data, that's great, and we happily display what we have done." So Norgeskart is not Kartverket's main product – their APIs and services are. Norgeskart is more a side-project that encourages the use of the APIs and services.

## It's your business model
Open source does not mean _free_, as you might have read this [December 18th](https://opensource.christmas/2019/18). [_Highcharts_](https://www.highcharts.com/) is a good example of this. Highcharts is a chart library, and [it's open source](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts). Their licensing model makes it free to use non-commercially, which has ensured wide and fast adaptation. But it's not free to use _commercially_. This has made Highsoft, the company behind it, one of Norway's [most profitable companies](https://www.bt.no/nyheter/okonomi/i/e8v5La/denne-gjengen-har-skapt-en-av-landets-aller-mest-loennsomme-bedrifter).

## And the answer is...
Have we found a simple answer to our simple question? No. There are many possible reasons to open-source your project. And there are the same number of reasons _not_ to do it, and we haven't talked about them yet. 

Why you should open-source your project primarily comes down to your principles and philosophy. Hopefully this article has helped enlighten some of the advantages of open source.
