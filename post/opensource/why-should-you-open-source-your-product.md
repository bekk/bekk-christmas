## You seek contributions from the community
This is maybe the most obvious reason. If your code is open sourced, outsiders can contribute to the development of the project. This is a strong argument for libraries, frameworks and tools where the target user group is developers.

## Transparency
One reason for open sourcing your code is to achieve _transparency_. You might want – or are required to – give people the possibility to read the code. This is a common argument for public companies, where the tax payers should be able to have insight into what is made, and therefore, what they pay for. [NAV](https://github.com/navikt) and [Digipost](https://github.com/digipost) and [Entur](https://github.com/entur) are examples of Norwegian public companies that follow this principle.
