* [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com)

  True stories from the dark side of the Internet. Hosted by security veteran Jack Rhysider. A podcast about hackers, breaches, shadow government activity, hacktivism, cybercrime, and all the things that dwell on the hidden parts of the network.
* [Hackable](https://hackablepodcast.com)

  This podcast covers topics that should be relevant for anyone even outside the security industry. From Wi-Fi to webcams and cars to computers, the episodes expose the places hackers may hit, and explain how they get our information. The hosts, Geoff Siskind and Bruce Snell, explore where weâ€™re susceptible in our daily routines, without even realizing it.
* [Security Now](https://twit.tv/shows/security-now)

  [](https://twit.tv/shows/security-now)Hosted by Steve Gibson, the man who coined the term spyware and created the first anti-spyware program, and Leo Laporte. They discuss, in understandable terms, the hottest topics and latest news in security today. 
* [Reply All](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all)

  Not really a pure security podcast, but rather about the "life on the internet" in general. It occasionally has some hacker stories. Hosted by PJ Vogt, Alex Goldman, and Emmanuel Dzotsi.
* [Hunting Warhead](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/387-hunting-warhead)

  Hunting Warhead follows journalists and police on a global mission to expose the darkest corners of the internet. Host Daemon Fairless tracks down the investigators, survivors and criminals themselves.
