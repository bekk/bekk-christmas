# @troyhunt

Troy Hunt is probably most known for being the author of the Have I Been Pwned? project, where people can check if their email credentials have been leaked in various data breaches. By collecting the database dumps and organizing these in services where users can check their own information, such as username or password. In addition to this Hunt is an active author and speaker. He will be attending NDC Security next year, be sure to catch him there.

On the KrebsOnSecurity you can find the work of American author and investigative reporter Brian Krebs. Krebs started his security reporting on The Washington Post in the late 1990-ies. Later he became known for his investigating reporting on crybercriminals. His daily posting on KrebsOnSecurity are always insightful and to the point.

Steve Gibson got his bragging rights designing light pen hardware for Apple II, creating software for recovering ZIP drives and hard drives. Today he is probably mostly recognized for being co-host of the Security Now podcast, where he reports on the latest news in addition to a deep dive into a security related topic. He is also the brain child behind SQRL.
