## Security Now!

When we started gathering pod cast for this post, Security Now! was one of the first that was listed. Since its start way back in '05 it has been a weekly listen for many in and outside the security business. Computer legend Steve Gibson and podcas pioneer Leo Laporte summarises, in understandable terms, the lastes security news. In addition there is usually a deep dive into a current topic. As a bonus the hosts share their opinions on sci-fi litterature, tv-show and movies. Note that Gibson also provide transcriptions of the shows, making is a valuable research tool. <https://twit.tv/shows/security-now>

## Darknet Diaries

> True stories from the dark side of the Internet

Host security vetran Jack Rhysider presents mesmerizing stories about incredible people doing stuff you never thought was possible outside the movies or tv-shows. Each episode typically tells the story of a security indcident, usually with interviews with the (for good reason) anonmyzed people involved. The well presented stories are filled with interesting facts and background infromation. Episode 6: The Beirut bank job is an incredible story about a peneration test gone bad, in an totally unexpected way. Jack Rhysider also maintains a webpage on https://www.tunnelsup.com which is well worth keeping up with. <https://darknetdiaries.com>
