ingress: He sees you when you’re sleeping, he knows when your awake, he knows if
  you ‘we been bad or good so be good for goodness sake. This is a line of a
  popular Christmas song. It obviously refers to Santa Claus. However… What if
  this is true, not only for Santa, but for large Companies worldwide. We’ll
  take a closer look on the data you give and the repercussions.

In today’s modern world, our phones are an integral part of our lives. We carry it everywhere, whether it is at work, when we are out and about or in the hospital. In every situation, our phone is nearby. The phone gives us easy access to information, communication and you might say there is an app for everything. If you need to see the local weather, it is right there in your phone, the same goes for the directions to the cinema or access to keeping updated on your friends lives. And it is all free of charge. Well, not exactly, nothing is free.

## The payment

Although you might not spend any money on an app, the app still collect a form of payment from you. Your information is the currency and is collected through every action you make on the internet and in the apps on your phone. Your device information, your likes and dislikes, email, phone number is just some of the data they might collect. And the hottest commodity is your location data. You might say the phone is a tracking device you willingly wear 24/7.

Some of this data, we give willingly. This can be photos, statuses, interests or in some cases, who your friends are, where you live and so on. It is easy to believe that the information you give to a specific app will be contained in this app. This is often not the case. Selling consumer data is a multi-billion-dollar industry and your data is sold to marketing companies, analytics companies and to research actors. All of these apps tracing your every action online does it knowingly, but sometimes also unknowingly.

Your data is tracks through and SDK. SDK’s can be compared to building blocks of applications. These are usually developed by other big companies and give you a set of functionality so the developers of the app do not have to do it themselves. With the usage of these SDK you consumer data might be tracked even though the developer of the app does not know it is happening.*

## I have nothing to hide

You might not know why you should care about the fact that your data is collected, you have nothing to hide. A couple of emails with “special offers” in terms of marketing might not be the worst thing. But here is why you should care. 

There are no restrictions on who can by this data. More stakeholders are showing interest in these data. In fact, earlier this year the wall street journal stated that the [U.S government bought commercially available location data] (<https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-agencies-use-cellphone-location-data-for-immigration-enforcement-11581078600)> and used if for detecting undocumented immigrants or others trying to get across the border. It was also used in finding a tunnel between the US and Mexico in an abandoned KFC used for drugs. 

The police usually have to get warrants to get the information of your phones, but what if they now can just buy it from the data brokers. Like [Bruce Sneider says](https://privacy-pc.com/interviews/bruce-schneier-nsa-is-wasteful-and-dangerous.html): 

“Whenever you make a new friend, you must inform the police”, we would never do that, but we willingly tell Facebook. And Or if the government says: “Whenever you send a message or write a letter or send a note to somebody, send us a copy, please”. However, google does it for you. There is easy access to everything about you.

You hear all the time that the data collected is anonymous. But when you give one bit to one app and another bit to another app. When seeing these data together and by simple searches on your address or other places you stay, your name is not hard to figure out. [The new York times]( https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html) bought location data and could easily find the person to whom the data belong to. Also \[NRK]( https://www.nrk.no/norge/xl/avslort-av-mobilen-1.14911685) form Norway did the same. They even found out that the person was going to interviews with another company, which he had not told anyone.
