This is in no way a definitive guide. It will provide moderate to high security towards the everyday band of marauders.

**Use a VPN.** 

VPN is a safe and easy way to protect yourself. Often your company will provide one, and if not, you can check out commercial alternatives. The point is to generate a private network between you and a machine you trust, where your traffic is “tunneled” through this network.

**Use your cellphone as a roaming hotspot.**

Instead of connecting to \_Free public Wi-Fi\_, which we know that in most cases are run by the bad guys, and provides no security, you can use your cellphone as a roaming hotspot for your devices. Watch out for high data fees.

**Disable biometric unlocking of device.**

If you know you are going to enter a country that allows the authorities to force you give up your biometric credentials, like fingerprint or facial id, this should be disabled. You are still allowed to forget a PIN or password.

On a side note; some countries may not allow you to enter a device into the country which you cannot unlock, so this can mean you will be denied access to the country.

**The Mikado-trick.**

If you at some point in your travels have to leave your laptop, let’s say for example in the hotel room. Take a bunch of Mikado sticks, drop them over your laptop, and snap a picture.

The randomness generated by the sticks are impossible to replicate and will provide an easy enough verification method to check if something has changed from when you left it.

**Password manager travel mode**

If you are using a password manager (and you should!!), you can enable travel mode. This removes password vaults from your devices, except those that you mark as “safe for travel”. So, if you have access to a company password vault, you should perhaps remove that vault before entering a country that would like that information. //TODO kanskje en bedre setning der..

**Buy it in the store.**

We know from the files Edward Snowden leaked that NSA has the capability to intercept a parcel from i.e. Amazon to do hardware modifications. This was shown with certain NAS-devices from Western Digital. 

If you go to your local computer-store, and buy the device there, and make sure that it does not leave your sight from when you pick it up, you can trust that it has not been tampered with.
