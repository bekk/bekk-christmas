  We wrote about ["Safe travels for the road
  warrior"](https://security.christmas/2019/21) last year, and this year we
  offer more tricks. This year we offer one more trick, and expand on this list
  for staying safe and secure on the road.


  Watch out for shoulder surfers, and protect your equipment if you have to leave it in ie. your hotel room.

*PANDEMIC WARNING: Stay at home if you can. A virus has for the better part of 2020 attacked physical infrastructure (people). We have no patch or hotfix, so while that is beeing worked out, we advice you to travel as little as possible.* 

## Shoulder surfers:

Be aware of your soundings and reduce the risk of shoulder surfers. A shoulder surfer describes someone is peaking over your shoulder to get information. I see people prone for this type of sosial engeneering attack all the time. When using public transport, in cafees, or on air planes. People use their laptop to check out some work stuff,  and don’t care if someone is looking.

To protect your information, you can, and should invest in a privacy shield for you screen. They cost next to nothing, but reduce/limit the viewing angle of your display.

Reduce the number of apps visible on your computer. On a Mac I recommend that you use [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/), but there are Windows and *Nix options as well. The point of this application is that it hides all the running apps from the menu bar, so that it looks like this:

rather than this abomination of a menubar:

The reason for hiding this information from shoulder surfers is that it tells alot about you. If someone knows what applications you are running, they know a lot about you. Developer tools, Automator scripts, and a password manager? You presumably work in IT. Bluetooth enabled, an old version of Outlook and a TorrentClient. You are prone for Metasploit. 

## Mikado security

The other tips is to not leave your computer laying around. This goes by itself, but there are times when this is impossible. There will be events where you have super secret stuff on your computer, and must step away for a period of time. For instance in a hotel room while you are away for an hour, or go to a resturant.

Mikado (also known as “pick-up sticks game”) is a game where players drop a bundle of sticks as a loose bunch onto a table top. Each player in turn tries to remove a stick from the pile without  disturbing any of the others.

MikadoSecurity is where you spread the sticks, over the object that you want to protect. You then take a picture of it, and when you return, you can verify that no one has tampered with your device. 
In the event that the sticks are not as you left them, you can escalate the problem. Either to do forensics, or discard the computer if  you need to.

This trick relies on the same principles as we rely on for computer  security. Prime number factoring, traveling salesman problem and SAT are hard to solve if P != NP, but easy to verify. 
An example of this is a sudoku board. It is hard for both humans and computers to solve, but if I hand you a board, it is easy for you to verify if I did it correct.
