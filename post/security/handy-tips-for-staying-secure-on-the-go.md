*Firstly: Stay at home if you can. This new type of virus that is going around is not cool, and not yet patched..* 

## Shoulder surfers:

Be aware of your soundings and reduce the risk of shoulder surfers. 
A shoulder surfer means that someone is peaking over your shoulder to get information. I see this all the time when using public transport, or on air planes. People use their laptop to check out some work stuff, and don’t care if someone is looking. 

To protect your information, you can, and should invest in a privacy shield for you screen. They cost basicly nothing, but reduce/limit the viewing angle of your display.

Reduce the number of apps visible on your computer. On a Mac I recommend that you use [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/). It hides all the running apps from the menu bar, so that it looks like this:

And not this abomination:

The reason I mean that you should hide this information from shoulder surfers is that if someone knows what applications you are running on your computer, they will know a lot about you. Lots of developer tools, Automator scripts, and a password manager? That is a whole lot of attack surface.. 

## Mikado security

The other tips is to not leave your computer laying around. This goes by itself, but if there is an event where you have super secret stuff on your computer, and you have to leave your computer. For instance in the hotel room while you are away for an hour I have a trick for you.

Mikado (also known as “pick-up sticks game”) security is where you take a whole bunch of Mikado-sticks, and spread them out over the object that you want to make sure that is not tampered with, and then you take a picture of it. When you return, you can easily verify that nothing has been tampered with. In the event that they have been tampered with, you can escalate, and either do forensics, or discard the computer if you need to.

This trick relies on the same principles as we rely on for computer security. Prime number factoring, traveling salesman problem and SAT are hard to solve if P != NP, but easy to verify.
A sudoku board is hard for both humans and computers to solve, but anyone can easily check that if board is solved.
