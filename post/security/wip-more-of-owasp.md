  The Open Web Application Security Project, or OWASP, is mostly know for it's
  Top Ten Project which covers the most critical web application security risks.
  They als maintain one of most popular free security tool, the OWASP Zed Attack
  Proxy. But there is more, so much more. In this post we cover some of our
  favorite tools by the OWASP project and how we use them.

# OWASP Serverless Top 10

Many developers are aware of the OWASP Top 10 and the [OWASP Mobile Top 10](https://security.christmas/2019/7/), but there is another top 10 list, which really deserves some attention. The OWASP Serverless Top 10 was released in late October 2018 and addresses the same issues as identified by the OWASP Top 10. As the name implies, the focus here is serverless.

Going serverless seems to be trending in many of the projects we involved in, and while serverless addresses many of the pains of deployment, scalability and availability (insert your favourite -bility here),is security solved once and for all? Tal Melamed of Protego Labs pointed out an interesting trend, by comparing Google searches on serverless (blue) vs serverless security (not blue).

The serverless top 10 project wants to address this by giving examples on how to pervent the various attacks. We expect to have many interesting cases in near future on how to secure applications and services deployed in the cloud.
