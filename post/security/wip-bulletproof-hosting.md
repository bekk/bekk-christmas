  When hearing about security breaches and typically cybercrime, one is
  sometimes left wondering, where are these servers hosted and why can't they be
  stopped?

Common attacks on systems are distributed denial of service attack (also known as DDOS-attacks). In this scenario a service or host is flooded with coordinated requests from a large number of clients, or computers in the internet. These computers are typically under the control of a botnet. It can be anything from a compromised blade server in the server rack or an IOT device on your home network, under the control of the attacker. Once the attack, the members known as bots, if you can call them members -- it implies some degree of volunteerism, either goes back idle or they are reassigned to some other task by the botnet. The bots can have a short or long lifespan in the botnet, they are expandable.

Other attacks such as deployment of malware, ransomware or command and control servers needs some more permanent servers. If the attack requires some more persistent point of contact a botnet may not be reliable enough. Hosting providers may not be as forgiving when they notice that their customers are hosting malicious content. If a botnet loses its command and control center, the whole operation may be stopped, and any financial gains lost.

Nefarious schemes also require reliable, stable hosting, pretty much the same as regular services.

Bulletproof hosting providers provide services which at first glance are the same as services from normal hosting providers, servers, redundancy and customer support. They also provide anonymous payment methods such as cryptocurrencies or even cash to avoid a paper trail or traceable credit cards. A common thing is that the servers are hosted in countries with a more relaxed law when it comes to what content is considered illegal. Without the legal framework required for a take down, the bulletproof hosting provider keep their servers running without too much interference. 

Some providers take this ever further by renting out compromised servers and stolen cloud service accounts. These servers are typically used for short term task, such as specific attacks or just computer intense tasks, password hashing for example.

The availability of bulletproof hosting providers seems to indicate that there is a thriving market for such services. But as these services become more prevalent, they are also exposing themselves to authorities. Recently the German police stormed the data center of CyberBunker. CyberBunker proudly stated that they host anything except child pornography and anything related to terrorism. The server location was a former cold war bunker which was built to withstand a nuclear attack. But as soon at one provider is taken down, it seems that another enterprising startup sees an opportunity and announces their bulletproof services.
