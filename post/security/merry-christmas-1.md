The last weeks, we have covered a lot of different topics. We started by giving you a few tips for a more secure application. Before we log out of this years calendar, which we certainly hope that you have enjoyed, we give give you a few more.



1. Sufficient logging and monitoring

Without sufficient logging you know very little about how you are app is doing. You can be under constant attack, without even knowing about it. Pay special attention to login-errors and failed validation of input. These things can be signs of someone trying to attack you. 

Use a centralized logging tool, so you have a chance to aggregate and search through your logs. Trigger alerts when something unusual happens. Log what you need to debug and follow a situation, but not more. To establish a good logging and monitoring regime is difficult. Evolve and learn over time.

2. Take control of your data

3. Never trust input

4. Don't expose more than you need to

5. Know your platform
