Security is still a hot topic, both in various projects we work on and in the national and international news. What just some years ago was an obscure topic only discussed by those in the know, we hear people talk about ransomware on the buss, the news regularly report on international cyber-attacks and crimes.

One of the most profiled incident this year was the attack on Hydro. As the days were getting longer in March, industry giant Hydro was attacked by ransomware. Even today we still do not know the full consequence of the attack. Sadly this is just one example where insecure systems were used as a spearhead to infect large computer networks cause millions in loss.

Even our personal devices are under attack. There is an increasing number applications for mobile operating systems that have been proven to contain malware.

We do not want to contribute to some medias fud, but we would like use our knowledge and experience to shed some light. Doing this we hope to help you pass the time until we can celebrate the festive season.

We hope you will enjoy our Christmas Calendar this year as much as we have fun creating it. Please spread the word and please help use make the last weeks of the year a safe one.

Remember to visit our other calendars.
