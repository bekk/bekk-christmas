ingress: This year we've seen how the need for efficient contact tracing during
  the pandemic has challenged citizens' rights for privacy. Governments in a
  rush to take action have cast aside privacy and anonymity of their citizens in
  order to "move fast" and capture valuable data for analysis. We believe this
  to be an unacceptable trade-off and we must find ways to keep users' privacy a
  built-in feature in all software we build.
