The overlap between a certain skepticism towards surveillance by the government (or other parties) and the interest and knowledge of security technologies is not insignificant. Most users of the internet has to some degree understood that most activities are traceable and there are probably someone that can see what you did when, even if your iPhone has private browsing enabled.

When the internet was developed way back when we have a sneaking suspicion that the inventors were more than happy that it actually worked. That they were able to route packets across the word using quite simple, but we designed protocols and techniques. Security was not high on their agenda.

Today however, we use the internet more than a science experiment, we use it for just about anything, from doing business, reading news, communicating and lets not forget, watch cat video on social media. The global nature of the internet gives just about any one, anywhere in the world can can publish content, from palm of their hand.

There are areas and situations where the consequence of posting news about for example an oppressing regime or leaking documents which proves misconduct by authorities can be dangerous for whistleblower.

The Onion Router is a network where traffic can be routed through a network which tries to conceal where the traffic originates. The idea is to enable privacy on the internet.



TODO: kort beskrivelse av protokollen, hva den l√∏ser (dra inn the darknet fra ingress), hvem som finansierer og litt om svakheter.
