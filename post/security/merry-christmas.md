  As you open the final post of this year's security.christmas, we logout of our
  social media accounts, shut down Slack (or mute it for a while at least) and
  put away our thin foil hats.

The last weeks have been hectic for everyone involved here at the Bekk Christmas Calendar Machine. The topics we have covered reflect some of the things we have been working this year. It has been an interesting year as security has become more mainstream. As software professionals we stride to make secure coding a core value and help our team members as best possible.

Like we said last year, please spread the knowledge of security and without sounding too touched by the holiday spirit, make it a better place. Maybe you should do like many of us in Bekk, spend some time planning how you should improve your own and coworker’s awareness of the threats we face today. Maybe you can gather the people that seems to care about security into a room and plan some company event. We have hosted several Capture The Flag events this year, which has been really fun, both for the organizers and the participants. But it can also be as easy as finding some videos from security conferences you can watch together and discuss if and how the topics are relevant for your team or organization.

But more importantly, spend the well-deserved chance to spend the time with your loved ones and rest assured that the security challenges will be waiting for you on the other side of Christmas.

We hope to hear from you, if not, we look forward to presenting next year’s calendar.

With hopes of a peaceful celebration, the security team at Bekk.
