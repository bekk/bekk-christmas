As two graduates who recently got a job as UX designers, we’ve learnt a lot these past five months. In this article we’re sharing five things we would have liked to have known before starting our careers.



# **1. Business and politics**

It might sound a bit strange, when working as a UX designer, everything doesn’t actually evolve around the needs of the users. We know: mind blowing, right? The need of the client, whether that is to make more money, a social mission or implementing new laws and regulations is often equally as important. This means that as designers we might have to think “how can we, with these business needs, make a good user experience?”.

When we started working as designers, we noticed how people were talking about politics. By this we mean the power relations between various stakeholders in the organisation in which you work as a designer. You should find out what responsibilities they have, what they are measured on and what engages them. This is vital to understand as a designer because, as previously mentioned, understanding the needs of the client could be equally as important as understanding the user needs. And in order to understand the needs of the client you need to know who to talk to, about what, and when. To summarise, even if you were to know everything about UX-design, without the position to execute your design, making change can be difficult.

“But how do I prepare for this?”, you may ask. Well, our best tip is simply to be aware of it when you start working. Look out for the different stakeholders, their needs, decision-making powers, what they are measured on and what engages them. Then, as with many things in life, you learn as you go!

# **2. Continuous design**

The design process, as taught in our education, was mainly focused on the gathering of knowledge about the user and their context in order to turn this knowledge into a product. Picture a mobile banking app where you conduct interviews and surveys in order to find out how the product should work, and then designing it. One shortcoming of ending the design process after design handoff is that valuable insights can still be found merely from the products existence. This notion of learning by doing is well-established in the design field and a vital part of **Continuous Design**. So, how can you try learning by doing in practice? We’ve gathered three examples from our own and other projects done by Bekk.

**Using Hotjar –** Hotjar is an easy to use tool that can be integrated in your product in order to learn more about users behaviour in your application. Among other things, you can create heatmaps of where users click, scroll or move their cursor in order to learn which functionality is used the most, find out what piece of information is the most popular and so on. This can help you design better experiences for users by prioritizing which information to show in a particular place. Hotjar also has the ability to record how users navigate your product. This can be useful when launching new functionality in order to see if there are any flaws that needs to be dealt with.\
\
**Asking questions about changes you’ve made –** Receiving feedback on ideas and gathering insights is essential when designing. That’s probably why conducting interviews or surveys is a popular way to find out if you’re on the right track with what you’re designing. Additionally, you should ask questions about recent changes you’ve made to the product in order to iterate on the existing design.

**Fake doors –** Try to create a “fake door” by implementing a button or a tiny bit of functionality in order to gain the users attention. When the user clicks the button you can tell them that the functionality isn’t done yet, and proceed to ask them questions about what they would like to see or which functionality that would be relevant to them.



# **3. Including developers in the design process**

Including developers in your design process can yield several benefits that you should be aware of. Among other things, you will get to know the technical limitations of the product you’re working on, making you able to design realistic features on the software. You will also receive feedback on your designs by people invested in what’s being made. You could also include developers in your data gathering activities in order to make them see why you design the way you do, and why certain functionality is more important than other. This is of course a vital part of working in a team.

In our experience, the designer, together with a product owner, decides how functionality is made. By working closely together with developers, you are able to find out what they are interested in. Maybe one of your developer colleagues wants to learn how to make animations or another would like to focus on software architecture. Knowing this allows for tailoring tasks according to your team and thus working by their strengths and interests. It is also vital to include them early on in the process so that you don’t design for something that is not technically feasible. 

# **4. Sketches as a tool for communication**

Sketches are simple drawings, usually drawn by hand, used to explore the product in the early stages of the design process. They are known for being useful because they are quick and easy to make and gets your idea across without costing too much time and effort. While this is very true, we have also experienced the real value of sketches as a tool for communication. When talking with various stakeholders that are part of the product development it is easy to assume that there exists a common ground of understanding. However as we designers know, everyone can have different mental models. Having rough sketches in front of everyone or making them on-the-go in the meeting (sounds intimidating, but is so useful) ensures that everyone is more likely to be on the same page. If a developer is present too, it can help uncover unknown technical complexities that you were unaware of. The sketches can then be used to talk about the technical complexity and how you might solve it or work around it (yet another example of why developers should be included in the design process).

# **5. Write lists**

A short and concise tip from us, and many other designers in Bekk, is to write lists! As I’m sure you can gather from everything we have written about thus far, a designers role is multi-faceted and includes keeping on top of many things at once. Having a way to keep track of decisions that are being made, tasks to do, people to talk to and meetings to attend will help you remember everything you have to do, but will also show you everything you have achieved! Sometimes, if you have had a day full of meetings, it could feel as if you have done little work. By looking at your list you can see all the meetings you have attended, people you have talked to and decision that have been made that are all important aspects of the work.

These are five different topics that we have learned a lot about during our first five months as UX-designers. What were your five most important learnings when you started?
