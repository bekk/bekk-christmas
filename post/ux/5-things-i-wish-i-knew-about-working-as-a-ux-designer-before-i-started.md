title: 5 things we wish we knew about working as a UX designer before we started

  design projects, and read books about UX. Little did we know that there are
  many aspects of being a UX designer that our degrees did not prepare us for.
  As we now approach our four-month mark working at Bekk, we have reflected on
  five aspects of working as UX designers we wish we had known about before
  starting. Maybe they can help you as an aspiring designer?

# 1. Understanding business and politics is just as important as understanding users

It might sound a bit strange, but when working as a UX designer, everything doesn‚Äôt revolve around the needs of the users. We know. Mind-blowing, right? The needs of the client are often equally as important ‚Äì whether they need to make money, have a social mission, or need to implement changes due to new laws and regulations. This means that as designers we might have to think ‚Äúhow can we, with these business needs, make a good user experience?‚Äù.

When we started working as designers, we noticed how our colleagues were talking about politics. We eventually understood this to mean the power dynamics between various stakeholders in the organization in which you work. Finding out what responsibilities these stakeholders have, how their success is measured, and what engages them is an important part of understanding the needs of the client. Understanding the stakeholders will help you gain a position in which you can execute your design. Because even if you were to know everything about UX-design, without the position to execute your design, making change can be difficult.

‚ÄúBut how do I prepare for this?‚Äù, you may ask. Our best tip is simply to be aware of it when you start working. Look out for the different stakeholders, their needs, decision-making powers, what defines their success, and what engages them. Then, as with many things in life, you learn as you go!

# 2. You can improve a design after its release by continuously gathering insight

In the traditional design process that we were taught, a designer figures out how the product should work, perhaps by conducting interviews and surveys, then designing a prototype to hand over to developers. One shortcoming of ending the design process after design handoff is that many insights await after a product is launched. Continuously learning and adjusting a design is called continuous design. In the past five months we‚Äôve tried this out in three different ways:

## See real behavior with Hotjar

Hotjar is a tool that can be integrated into your product to learn more about users' behavior. Among other things, you can create heatmaps of where users click, scroll or move their cursor to learn which functionality is used the most, find out what piece of information is the most popular, and so on. This can help you design better experiences for users by prioritizing which information to show in a particular place. Hotjar can also record how users navigate your product, making you able to see how real users interact with the product.

## Ask questions about changes you‚Äôve made

Getting feedback on ideas and gathering insights is essential when designing. That‚Äôs probably why conducting interviews or surveys is a popular way to find out if you‚Äôre on the right track. But you should also include questions in your interviews or surveys about changes that have already been done. This way you can get feedback on how a user reacted to the change and how it affected their task.

## Consider creating fake doors

You can create a ‚Äúfake door‚Äù by implementing a button or a tiny bit of functionality to gain the users' attention. When the user clicks the button you can tell them that the functionality isn‚Äôt done yet, and proceed to ask them questions about what they would like to see or which functionality that would be relevant to them. This way you can receive feedback on functionality before it‚Äôs done.

# 3. Why you should include developers in the design process

At school, we often worked in groups of designers. This is a fun and educational form of learning. What we found through our recent months of working is that including developers can also yield several benefits that you should be aware of.

Involving developers in your design process can provide the technical insight needed to make sure your designs are technically feasible. As team members, they are also invested in the product and can provide valuable feedback. When developers are included in your design research process, they can be your allies and share an understanding of why certain features are more important than others. This is of course a vital part of working in a team. You can also find out what they are interested in. Maybe one of your developer colleagues wants to learn how to make animations or another would like to focus on software architecture. Knowing this allows you to tailor tasks according to your team and thus working with their strengths and interests.

# 4. Sketches are a valuable tool for communication

Sketches are simple drawings, usually drawn by hand, used to explore product ideas in the early stages of the design process. They are known for being useful because they are quick and easy to make and communicates your idea without costing too much time and effort. While this is very true, the real value of sketches are as a tool for communication. When talking with various stakeholders that are part of the product development process it is easy to assume that there exists a mutual understanding. However, as we designers know, everyone can have different mental models. Having rough sketches in front of everyone or making them on-the-fly in the meeting (sounds intimidating, but is so useful) ensures that everyone is more likely to be on the same page. If a developer is present too, it can help uncover unknown technical complexities that you were unaware of. The sketches can then be used to talk about technical complications and how you might solve or work around them (yet another example of why developers should be included in the design process).

# 5. Writing lists will help you keep on top of your work

A short and concise tip from us and many other designers in Bekk is to write lists! As I‚Äôm sure you can gather from everything we have written about thus far, a designer's role is multi-faceted and includes keeping on top of many things at once. Having a way to keep track of decisions being made, tasks to do, people to talk to, and meetings to attend will not only help you remember everything you have to do, but will also show you everything you have achieved! Sometimes, if you have had a day full of meetings, it can feel as if you haven‚Äôt done much work. By looking at your list you can see all the meetings you have attended, people you have talked to, and decisions that have been made: all important aspects of the work.

These are five different topics that we have learned a lot about during our first four months as UX-designers. Had we known this before, starting our careers might have been a tad easier. But what‚Äôs life without a challenge, eh?
