In his book _Serious creativity_, [Edward De Bono](https://www.debono.com/) presents his knowledge from more than 50 years of research on creativity. In it, he presents creativity as a skill that can be tought. Following are some of the key takeaways from the book.

## The definition of creativity
We all have perceptions, concepts, and boundaries, creativity is about challenging these. Creativity is about breaking patterns and giving us an alternative approach to logical thinking in pursuit of solving problems. With creativity, we move beyond what is and into what could be. 

## Misconceptions
We have many misconceptions when it comes to creativity, some of these are:
- "Creativity is something you’re born with; it can’t be learned."
- "You have to be artistic to be creative."
- "Creativity is crazy and illogicial."
- "Creativity requires very specific conditions."

These represent a narrow, incomplete view of creativity and are holding us back. Take the last quote as an example – the thought that certain conditions make you creative is not entirely wrong. Everyday hassles can inhibit us from being creative. But by eliminating them, it can become easier to be creative. Conditions are therefore not a prerequisite for creativity. Neither is “being artistic”. It would seem that many see creative vs logical as two extreme traits on an identity spectrum and would therefore identify as logical over creative.

To find at the difference, we first need to know a bit about how the brain works. 
The brain is a self-organizing information system. That is, it collects and organizes information on the fly. Previous knowledge as well asand the order of new information affect how this new information is stored.

Knowing this shows that our concept of "logical thinking" is fragile. In logical thinking, we start with a problem and navigate the information we have about that problem until we find a solution. This usually is efficient as we have solved similar problems before, but when there are novel problems we might get stuck in limiting patterns. 

Creative thinking helps us break free from these patterns and navigate our knowledge in different ways. By using techniques such as "random input" and "provocation" we can change where we start our thinking process and therefore end up with other solutions than we could by logical thinking. 


## Creative techniques
Then how do we break these limiting patterns? There are many techniques we can use to trick our minds into thinking creatively, including "Random Input" and "Provocation".

Random input is a method where a list of random input, usually words, but photos could work too, is collected and shared one item at a time. The person ideating thinks of a problem and uses the random input to affect the ideas they generate. The random input helps you break the logical patterns you are used to following and forces you to take detours through other topics that might seem unrelated but can spark new ideas.

Provocation works similarly to random input. By providing a provocation that might seem illogical, and taking the time to think about the implications of the provocation, you can come up with ideas outside of our usual patterns. This can be thought of like 30 seconds of madness. 

## Creativity: a challenge to our perceptions, consepts and boundaries
Creativity challenges our perceptions, concepts, and boundaries. Our understanding of creativity affects how we use it. Knowing creativity is a skill that can be tought and used in serious situations enhances our options when solving problems.
