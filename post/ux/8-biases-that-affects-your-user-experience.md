  People love delightful digital experiences. It can make the dullest of tasks —
  an exciting experience. Like filling in forms and paying for groceries. So why
  aren't every digital experience delightful?

# What is delightful user experiences?

Let's get an idea of the concept by looking at some examples.

<br/>

**Reacting on Facebook post**\
Do you see those small, delightful animations? Does the cute angry emoji shaking its head make you smile? It might seem excessive, and Facebook could easily have used static icons. But those small details make you want to react on posts — even if the post itself is not engaging.

**Sending emails via Mailchimp**\
Mailchimp has mastered delight in their communication. When your startup has spent all its energy creating a campaign for growth hacking, you'll proof-read the email you're sending over and over. But you might still be a bit angsty. When you are sending those emails to all your users, this is what Mailchimp shows you:

They could have shown a "are you sure?" status message, but the animation tells us so much more. It understands the context. It playfully conveys the angsty feeling.  It's telling users normal to be a bit stressed.

When you have sent the emails, they do the same. They could have shown a status message labeled "emails sent". But they give us this delightful message instead:

**Looking at products on webshops**\
Creating delight can be done in several ways. These websites show us the same products, at the same price, but present them differently. Mainly using white space generously to create a more or less delightful presentation:

**Apple Pay**\
Apple is experts at making delightful experiences, and Apple Pay is a great example. Using your physical credit card might be faster. Rewards are possibly more useful or plentiful. But Apple Pay is such a delightful experience; you'll smile every time you pay.  The experience is a fantastic orchestration of physical movement, slick transitions, loads of white space, snappy animations, clear audiovisual and physical feedback. If you haven't tried it yourself, you can get a grasp of the experience here:

# Why should experiences be delightful?

By now, I hope you have an understanding of delight in the context of user experiences. But why should products and services be delightful? When I started doing UX work, I asked myself this constantly. Since then, I have worked in several agile product teams. In agile work environments, maximizing value creation is always at the top of your mind. While aesthetic and delightful experiences are something you aim for as a UX designer, you and your team need to spend a lot of time getting there. Time your team wants to spend making new products, creating new features, or fixing bugs — since it seems more effective for creating value.

My focus shifted after I delved into the world of psychology.\
<br/>

**People are humans — not robots.**\
Duh uh. But we often forget the implications of this when we create digital services. Humans are faulty. We make choices based upon our past experiences and the knowledge stored in our brains. Our knowledge contains a lot of gaps, but maybe worse, are full of incorrect information. Our brain tries to understand the world around us constantly and unconsciously. When it sees patterns, our brain stores it as concepts in our long term memory by insulating the pathways between networks of neurons. Undoing these strengthened brain paths becomes harder and harder as time goes. Misunderstandings become facts.

At the same time, our energy-hungry brain tries to preserve energy all the time. One strategy it has is habits. Have you done something before? Do not waste energy on making the same decision again. Another one is motivation — rewarding energy-persevering and energy-gaining behavior with addictive drugs such as dopamine. A third strategy is feelings. The brain summarizes the body's energy budget, situational and social context, internal and external perceptions, as fellings to our consciousness. Feelings leave lots of information outside of energy-intensive conscious processes.

Okay. What does all this mean? Well. Humans make decisions based on their feelings, motivations, habits, and error-prone knowledge. People are not logical, like computers. The same person might end up with an entirely different choice, depending on whether they're hungry or not. If your app asks a user to rate it, the user might give it one star if they broke up with their loved one the same day. A lot of your users might consent to marketing-emails if you ask on a payday. You cannot understand the actions of users by solely looking at their behavior in the context of the service itself.

**Human behaviour and its implications in digital experiences**\
A lot of digital experiences are entertaining at its core, like games or video services. Users are highly motived to use these services. But digization of both governmental and private functions, have created a slew of useful, but dull, tools and services.

![Human-human interaction](/assets/human-1.png)

In many cases, manual work has been automated. Before digitization, users contacted a person in order to use a service. Paying bills, ordering food, buying movie tickets, or canceling their subscriptions. Often, this interaction has been replaced by a form. The app or website usually only replaces the former workers' transactional function. Input from the user, output from the system. The human part of the system is lost.

Human functions that are typically lost; 

* Correcting information, often without telling the users (like formatting errors) 
* Adjust the amount of information or complexity, making it understandable to different users
* Motivate users, when they lack the motivation to finish a transaction or task
* Making the customer feel safe or feel like choices are made correctly
* Make users feel heard and seen
* Noticing users emotions and changing behavior to fit their emotions
* Help users navigate when they are lost
* Help users self-reflect

While delight in UX cannot change what users experience outside of the services we create, we can make our systems more human with it.

<br/>

**Defining the usefulness of delightful UX**\
When looking at successful products and services, they tend to be at the intersection of three lenses. They are feasible (it is possible to make), they are viable (it makes sense financially) and they are desirable (users will come and stay).

![Venn diagram of three aspects of products](/assets/venn.001.png)

When are products desirable? In order to make more sense of it, we can look at three aspects of desirability. Utility, usability, and delight. The utility is the most objective quality. Services and products with high utility are useful. They solve user problems or needs. Usability is slightly fuzzier. High usability means that users are able to use the product. They understand how to interact with it. In the world of UX, conversion rates are typically correlated with usability. The last aspect, delight, is the most mysterious. It tells us if users want the product, or like to use it.

Let's look at an example. A bottle of sugarfree soda. The utility is its ability to quench thirst. The bottle fits your hand, you can hold it and you can place it on a surface, you can easily open and close the cap. In other words, it is highly usable. But why did you buy this soda? You could have bought a bottle of water or you could have quenched your thirst at the tap. It must have some delightful aspects. Maybe it tastes great?

Delight is the quality that makes a useful service or product, something that users want to use even when they don't need to.
