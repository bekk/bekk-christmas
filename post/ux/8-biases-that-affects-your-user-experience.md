# What is a delightful UX?

Let's get an idea of the concept by looking at some examples.

<br/>

**Reacting on Facebook post**\
Do you see those small, delightful animations? Does the cute angry emoji shaking its head make you smile? It might seem excessive, and Facebook could easily have used static icons. But those small details make you want to react on posts — even if the post itself is not engaging.

**Sending emails via Mailchimp**\
Mailchimp has mastered delight in their communication. When your startup has spent all its energy creating a campaign for growth hacking, you'll proof-read the email you're sending over and over. But you might still be a bit angsty. When you are sending those emails to all your users, this is what Mailchimp shows you:

They could have shown a "are you sure?" status message, but the animation tells us so much more. It understands the context. It playfully conveys the angsty feeling.  It's telling users normal to be a bit stressed.

When you have sent the emails, they do the same. They could have shown a status message labeled "emails sent". But they give us this delightful message instead:

**Looking at products on webshops**\
Creating delight can be done in several ways. These websites show us the same products, at the same price, but present them differently. Mainly using white space generously to create a more or less delightful presentation:

**Apple Pay**\
Apple is experts at making delightful experiences, and Apple Pay is a great example. Using your physical credit card might be faster. Rewards are possibly more useful or plentiful. But Apple Pay is such a delightful experience; you'll smile every time you pay.  The experience is a fantastic orchestration of physical movement, slick transitions, loads of white space, snappy animations, clear audiovisual and physical feedback. If you haven't tried it yourself, you can get a grasp of the experience here:

# Why bother making products delighful?

When I started doing UX work, I asked myself this constantly. Since then, I have worked in several agile product teams. In an agile work environment, maximizing value creation is always at the top of your mind. While aesthetic and delightful experiences are something you aim for as a UX designer, you and your team need to spend a lot of time to get there. Time your team wants to spend making new products, creating new features, or fixing bugs — since it seems more effective for creating value.

My focus shifted after I delved into the world of psychology and saw the effects of delight by the numbers.

# Challanges

# Lets get theoretical

# Examples of theory in practice

# Where should you start?

# But wait, what about business impact?
