title: So you’ve opened Figma, now what?
ingress: Maybe you have just been hired in a company and you are forced to use
  Figma. Maybe you have been using Sketch and Abstract for the last years and
  heard some good things about this new, up and coming business. Hell, maybe you
  even have used Figma for a while and you’re curious if maybe there are still
  some tricks you haven’t yet learned. Well, look no further! The answers to all
  some of your questions lie beyond!

# Where are you going with this?

An excellent question! While you were fast asleep getting your regular six to seven hours, I was up all night making a Figma course for you. So kick back and relax, enjoy your raw cocoa and bee pollen coffee and enjoy the show. That is a bit of a lie though, because you have to do most of the work from here on out…

I believe the quickest way to learn something is to try it for yourself. Therefore, I’ve decided that the best way to introduce you to Figma is to make a Figma file filled to the brim with practical exercises for you to explore and learn from. My goal is at the end of the course, you know enough Figma to start creating sketches and wireframes of your own. The tutorial is inside the downloadable Figma-file so you can add it to your own files and look at it whenever you want. You’re welcome.

# Cool, so what’s in this course?

I’m glad you asked, friend! Inside the course I’ll show you the layout and features of Figma and how to use them. You will be introduced to different concepts and get an overview of shortcuts and other techniques for making your life easier.

# How do I begin?

Download the file from the link below and import it into Figma. Then it’s just a matter of opening the file and we’re off!

If you don’t know how to import files into Figma yet, don’t you worry! Our good friends over at Figma have put together an easy tutorial for just that.
