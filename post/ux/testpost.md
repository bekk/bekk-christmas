title: Your product team needs an insight retro
ingress: Who is responsible for insights in a product team?
authors: []

The list of different pieces of information needed to navigate a product in its environment towards a goal, is a long one. A product team is just like a group of pirates on a ship navigating towards their next treasure. They need to know about the nautical terrain, weather forecast and enemy ships to navigate successfully. Like in a product team, the team of pirates has their different roles and responsibilities—and therefore their own separate piece of the truth about how the ship can reach their goal.

On many pirate ships the responsibility of navigation falls on the cartographer (designer)—the person who draws the map becomes responsible for navigational research as a whole. But in order to chart a good map, you regularly need to get out of the navigation room to get an overview of the area. Also, the map is just a part of the picture. The skipper (tech lead) might know crucial information about the ship’s condition and the war pirate (marketing) might know best which routes that are safest to take. These insights are scattered on deck and rarely shared between the pirates. When the ship is out at sea, the waves are rolling and the captain (product manager) is drunk on rum, the team needs a way to regularly share and follow up necessary research to successfully navigate towards the treasure. 

## A ritual

Over the last year we have experimented and researched how to stitch treasure maps together for product teams that are out at sea. Inspired by other successful rituals like team retros we tried to make a ritual that injected product insights into the team culture. 

Why a ritual?

* We want to build a insight-based culture, to build a culture we need to change behaviour and gather around a common belief. A successful way of doing this through history has been rituals and artefacts.
* We want to create an arena for insight to be shared. We need a group of different contributors that can share their insight.
