Elm is still a very young programming language in the grand scheme of programming languages, but has still managed to get som classic and defining talks. For some people in the community these are be well known and for others these might be a discovery.

Even though these talks are Elm talks they have lessons that can be applied to other languages as well.

## The life of a file - Evan Czaplick

Link: <https://youtu.be/XpDsk374LDE>

Lenght: 47 minutes

>In this talk Evan addresses the question "How do I grow Elm code?". Along with practical examples we get some great insight into how to think about different solutions and modeling the problems space with our code. It is also exciting to get a peak into the mind of the creator of Elm. 

## Making Impossible States Impossible - Richard Feldman

Link: <https://youtu.be/IcgmSRJHu_8>

Length: 25 minutes

>This title is so iconic, it has almost become a meme! The talk illustrates how getting your data model right can remove a lot of issues and get rid of those pesky "This should not happen" situations in our code.


## Elm Radio reflections

For those interesed in nerding out on these topic I would recommend checking out the two corresponding episodes of [Elm Radio](https://elm-radio.com/) where Dillon Kearns and Jeroen Engels reflect and discuss these classic talks.

## In closing

What are some need-to-watch talks for you language of choise? Are there other talks in Elm that you would highlight?
