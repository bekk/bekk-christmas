Elm is young language in the grand scheme of programming languages, but the community has still managed to produce some classic and defining talks. For some people in the community these are well known and for others these might be a discovery.

Even though these talks are Elm talks they have lessons that can be applied to other languages as well.

## The life of a file - Evan Czaplick

Link: <https://youtu.be/XpDsk374LDE>

Length: 47 minutes

>In this talk Evan addresses the question "How do I grow Elm code?". Along with practical examples we get some great insight into how to think about different solutions and modeling the problems space with our code. It is also exciting to get a peak into the mind of the creator of Elm. 

## Making Impossible States Impossible - Richard Feldman

Link: <https://youtu.be/IcgmSRJHu_8>

Length: 25 minutes

>This title is so iconic, it has almost become a meme! ðŸ˜Ž The talk illustrates how getting your data model right can remove a lot of issues and get rid of those pesky "This should not happen" situations in your code.


## Elm Radio reflections

For those interested in nerding out on these topic I would recommend checking out the two corresponding episodes of [Elm Radio](https://elm-radio.com/) where Dillon Kearns and Jeroen Engels reflect and discuss these classic talks.

- [#014 The life of a file](https://elm-radio.com/episode/life-of-a-file/)

## In closing

What are some need-to-watch talks for you language of choice? Are there other talks in the Elm community that you would highlight?
