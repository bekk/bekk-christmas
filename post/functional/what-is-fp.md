Hi there, and welcome to this advent calendar! While you wait for christmas, we'll provide you with an article related to Functional Programming (FP) each day until december 24 ðŸŽ…

We will try to tackle a wide range of topics. We will cover a few "classic" FP-concepts, both basic and more advanced. We also aim to have some articles with a more practical focus. Some posts will be intended for beginners and some will have a more experienced audience in mind. So if a particular article isn't for you, hopefully the next one will be!

To get the show on the road, lets start out by answering the following question:

## So, what is Functional Programming anyway?

Functional Programming is, like Object Oriented Programming (OOP), a programming paradigm. There isn't a formal agreed-upon definition of what FP entails, but there are two core concepts most people would agree are central to the paradigm: 

1. Avoiding mutating state and changing state
2. Using functions as the central building block of programs

Lets discuss each of these in turn.

### Immutability

In functional programming, we strive to avoid mutating state. In fact, in many functional languages modifying a "variable" is simply impossible. If you're new to FP this might sound very strange, but it's actually really nice when you get used to it.

In return for giving up the possibility to mutate state in our programs, we get some really nice benefits back.

Don't tell anyone, but we will return to this topic in later article ðŸ¤«

### Functions as building blocks
