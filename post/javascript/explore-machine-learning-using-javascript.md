title: Machine learning with JavaScript
ingress: If you have been following our JavaScript Christmas calendar, chances
  are you have some interest, and perhaps even proficiency, in the JavaScript
  programming language. For this blog entry in particular, I hope you also have
  at least some interest in data science and machine learning. I will
  demonstrate how you can use your JavaScript skills to develop entry-level data
  science and machine learning applications, and provide you with tons of
  additional resources to further expand your knowledge of this subject.

For those unaware, machine learning is a field focusing on the development of algorithms which are trained rather than explicitly programmed. Interest in machine learning has skyrocketed the last couple of decades, much thanks to the increased processing capabilities of modern computers. Machine learning algorithms can be used to solve problems like [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification), [regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis), [sequence mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_pattern_mining), [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision), [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition) and more. Tools like [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) have made machine learning accessible for the masses, by enabling users with consumer grade GPUs or even CPUs to experiment with state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Some popular libraries are [ConvNet.js](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/) for deep learning, [Brain.js](https://brain.js.org/#/) for neural networks, and [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) for machine learning in general.

Considering that JavaScript is widely and primarily used to develop interactive web pages, one might ask why you should use JavaScript for machine learning? After all, there are more popular options readily available, like Python or R. Firstly, the interactivity of JavaScript is very sought-after and useful when using educational or entry-level applications. Additionally, if JavaScript is your primary programming language, the entry barrier for starting with machine learning using a library like TensorFlow.js is almost non-existent.

We could only dream of covering all parts of machine learning with a hundred blog posts like this, and so...
