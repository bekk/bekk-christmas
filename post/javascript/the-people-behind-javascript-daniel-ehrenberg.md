## Who are you and what do you do?

I'm Daniel Ehrenberg, a TC39 delegate and a partner at Igalia, a free
software consultancy.

## How did you get into programming?

I used to program little games on my TI-83 calculator when I was 12 or
so. From there, I wanted to learn "real programming" on the computer,
but didn't know where to start. So I ended up reading about a lot of
different programming languages, trying to figure out which was the best
to learn.

## What do you like about JavaScript?

I like how JavaScript is generally both free-form and uniform, when it
comes to how you use objects, how lexical scoping and closures work,
etc. Its base is both minimal and free of arbitrary restrictions.

And I like how JavaScript is everywhere, adding an layer of
programmability accessible to a wide range of people.

## How did you get involved in the development of EcmaScript?

When I was working at Google on various Linux kernel/firmware teams, I
saw an internal job opening for the V8 sub-team working on new language
features. At the time, this was implementing ES6. I jumped at the
chance, and quickly found myself on TC39, pushing forward SIMD.js and
working out the unfinished bits of ES6.

## What's a contribution you are proud of?

I'm really proud of the JavaScript BigInt feature. It was the work of a
lot of people, but I helped by pushing it through the TC39 process and
editing the proposed specification. This feature lets you work with
integers of any size, without arbitrary restrictions like BigInt has.

## What's an upcoming propsal you are excited about, and why?

I'm excited about the BigDecimal proposal. This would be a new numeric
type that can represent numbers like people write them: with base-10
decimals of unlimited size represented precisely, without rounding
errors. You can find more information at
https://github.com/littledan/proposal-bigdecimal .

## What is the most fun about being a part of the development of
EcmaScript?

It's really fun to dream about new language features and think through
the details and the design space. I really like how I get to learn about
all sorts of different problems in a somewhat deep way, in terms of how
they interact with the JavaScript language.

## What is the hardest part about developing a programming language?

Working with a large group of people and understanding their problems
and concerns, and resolving conflicts between these.

## What do you wish you knew before you started contributing to the
development

I wish I knew how important and complicated it was to both listen and to
reach out and seek feedback. Initially, I thought that we could get
"correct" answers could be reached through first-principles reasoning
and just negotiating with people who assert themselves. I don't think
that that sort of development process will actually meet people's needs;
it's not inclusive enough to actually understand the real problems.

## How do you hope JavaScript will evolve in the future?

I hope the language will evolve in a gradual, open, community-based way,
and that TC39 will remain a good place to solve problems that exist at
the language level. I can't give a single answer here: The needs of
JavaScript programmers will change over time as the community grows and
evolves. I hope TC39 will be ready to meet these needs, in a thoughtful,
stable, dependable way.
