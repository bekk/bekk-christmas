  Did you know that JavaScript is the world's NO. 1 most popular language? At
  least according to Github and Stack Overflow. As a developer, that is a huge
  reason to get to know it better, isn't it?

# The story

Way back in 1995, the rumours has it that the American computer scientist Brendan Eich wrote a brand new language using only 10 days. At this time back in Norway, we were still riding the wave of hosting the winter olympics in Lillehammer the year before (sometimes I'm thinking we still are).

At this time, Eich was working for Netscape, one of the coolest tech companies in that decade. He called his new programming language Mocha, but it was later on renamed to LiveScript (when shipped with Netscape Navigator), and later JavaScript. 

Just like the Norwegians, Netscape also wanted to ride the wave, the wave of the super-popular language Java.

Introduced as "the scripting language" shipped with Netscape
