## [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
This is a resource created for developers by developers, and is loaded with articles, tutorials, references and documentation on many subjects such as JavaScript, CSS and WebAssembly. You can find information aimed towards all kinds of experience here, which also applies to the tutorials and guides. When it comes to JavaScript in particular, MDN has a lot to offer and I think that almost everyone reading this article can learn something here. There is one guide which you just need to check out named [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) This is a detailed guide that gives a great overview of the language and is divided into multiple chapters that covers topics such as functions, working with objects, promises, modules and so on. This guide is directed primarily against those who have previous experience with JavaScript or other languages. In addition to that guide, here is some interesting tutorials on JavaScript that MDN offer:

* [JavaScript First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps)
* [Introducing JavaScript objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects)
* [Client-side web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs)
* [Memory Management](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management)

## [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/)
This is a website that provides short, on point, informative video courses on JavaScript, web frameworks and libraries. The courses are for both newcomers and experienced JavaScript developers and is made by both professionals and open source contributors. Most of the courses consist of small bite size videos rather than long ones, and the videos goes straight to the point, so you can save time. Each course is made up of 10-30 videos on interesting topics such as:

* [JavaScript Promises in Depth](https://egghead.io/courses/javascript-promises-in-depth)
* [Just Enough Functional Programming in JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/just-enough-functional-programming-in-javascript)
* [JavaScript ES2019 in Practice](https://egghead.io/courses/javascript-es2019-in-practice)

Egghead has a lot of great content that are free, but you have to pay in order to get full access to all of the websites content.

## [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/)
This website and its content are made by a full stack web-developer and designer named Wes Bos from Hamilton, Canada. The website has a blog with plenty of references to courses, videos and articles that Wes Bos has made. On this [blog](https://wesbos.com/blog/) you can find useful resources on learning the basics, but also resources on more advance topics in the realm of web development. Some of the resources are free and some you have to pay for. If there is one resource you have to check out from Mr.Bos, it must be his famous [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course. This is a 30-day vanilla JavaScript coding challenge, where you can join over 300 000 others to learn vanilla JavaScript in 30 days with 30 tutorials.

## [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)
You just canâ€™t make a list like this without mentioning YouTube. There are just so many great courses on this platform and the best about the platform is that itâ€™s 100% free. I personally got in to JavaScript just by watching courses on YouTube. So I will list some popular channels which I have discovered that has a lot of great video courses on JavaScript, but also web-development in general.

* [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ)
* [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)
* [derek banas](https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas/videos)


## Books 
Finally, I will share two free books with you.

* [Eloquent javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) This is a dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code.

* [You Don't Know JS Yet](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) which is a free series of books that lets you explore the ins and outs of JavaScript and its core mechanisms.

There you have it, a full list of resources about JavaScript which you can enjoy during the holidays. ðŸŽ…ðŸ¤¶
