ingress: The new version of ECMAScript, ES2021 is expected to be released in
  June 2021. What new features can we expect from the new release? This article
  covers some of the features in the upcoming release, and how we can put them
  to use.

## String replaceAll()
This is perhaps the feature I am most excited about. With the old approach, in order to replace all occurrences of a substring, the method  ```replace() ``` combined with a global regular expression has been the way to go.
However, with the new method ```replaceAll()```, we can easily return a new string that replaces all instances of a pattern without the use of complicated regex.

```javascript
const myString =
  "I love Cats. Cats are supercute, especially when they are doing Catstuff";

let newString = myString.replaceAll("Cat", "Dog");

console.log(newString);

//I love Dogs. Dogs are supercute, especially when they are doing Dogstuff
```

This method also comes with a performance improvement as it uses string comparisons instead of regular expression matching.

## Logical Assignment Operator
The Logical Assignment Operator combines Logical Operators ( ```&&, ||, ??```) with Assignment Expressions (```=```). 

The code example below shows this feature in use on the operators AND (```&&```), OR (```||```) and the Nullish Coalescing Operator (```??```) as well.

```javascript
//Only assigns if left-hand side is Truthy
//Old approach
a && (a = b)

//Logical assignment operator
a &&= b

//Only assigns if left hand-side is Falsy
//Old approach
a || (a = b)

//Logical assignment operator
a ||= b 

//Only assigns if left hand side is Nullish (null / undefined)
//Old approach
a ?? (a = b)
//Logical assignment operator
a ??= b
```
In the example below we have the variable ```money```  where the default value is ```null```.

 ```javascript
let money = null;
money = money ?? 1;

//Using the Logical assignment operator
money ??= 1
 ```

Curious about Operators? Stay tuned, there might be an article about the topic further into this JavaScript Christmas calendar :angel:.

## Numeric Separators
Large numbers may be challenging to read with a first glance, especially when there are repeating digits. The Numeric Separator is a useful tool that separates digits with an underscore (```_```) in numeric literals, thus making numeric literals more readable. The separator can be used in different positions, with as many separators as you want, in groups of any size.

 ```javascript
const oneMillion = 1000000;
const oneMillionWithSeparators = 1_000_000;
const oneMillionAndALittleMore = 1_000_000.123_456;
 ```

As we can see, the code becomes a lot more readable. Numeric separators also work for octal integer literals

## Promise.any()
In short, this method is the opposite of ```Promise.all()```. ```Promise.any()``` takes an iterable of promise objects, and resolves if any of the supplied objects resolves. It returns a single promise, the first one to resolve, with the value from that promise.

Consider the example below, we create three promises which we feed into ```Promise.any()```.

 ```javascript
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'first'));
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 300, 'second'));
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'third'));

const promises = [promise1, promise2, promise3];

Promise.any(promises).then((value) => console.log(value));

// Expected output: "first"
 ```

If none of the promises resolve, then a new type of exception, the ```AggregateError``` exception is thrown. ```AggregateError``` groups together individual errors into a single error in the form of an array of objects. Pretty neat!

## WeakRef
In JavaScript, references to objects are strongly held. This means that as long as a reference to the object exists, the object will not be garbage-collected but keeps the object in memory. 

 ```javascript
var a, b;
a = b = document.querySelector('.someClass')
a = undefined
// ... GarbageCollecting...
// b is still references to the DOM-object .someClass
```

In scenarios where we do not want to keep objects in memory indefinitely, the ```WeakRef``` (Weak Reference) can be used to implement caches or mappings to large objects. When not in use, the memory can be garbage collected and generate a fresh cache when needed again.

A WeakRef is created using ```new WeakRef```, and the reference is read with ```.deref()```.

 ```javascript
const x = new WeakRef(document.querySelector('.someClass'));
const element = x.deref();
 ```

JavaScript is continuously integrating new features, and today we have looked into some of the features coming in JavaScript ES2021. For more information on proposals, and whatÂ´s coming next, take closer look [here](https://github.com/tc39/proposals)
