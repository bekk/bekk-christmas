  JavaScript is a fast-paced language in regards to adaption and growth. By the
  end of 2017 there was an estimated 9.7 million JavaScript developers, which
  suggest that we might have passed [10 million in
  2018](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180868064080/this-year-in-javascript-2018-in-review-and-npms).

With that many developers it might not come as a surprise that [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) (the node package manager) is the largest collection of open-source libraries on the planet ([over 836,000](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180868064080/this-year-in-javascript-2018-in-review-and-npms) packages and counting - so go publish one!). [TC-39](https://javascript.christmas/2018/1) has also vowed to develop the ECMAScript standard and publish a new version every year with [new features](https://github.com/tc39/proposals). This means that keeping up with the amount of activity in the JavaScript community can become a daunting task, but not impossible! The best way of staying up-to-date is to follow developers and JavaScript enthusiasts on Twitter. So don't get lost in the JavaScript jungle, use this list of recommendations as your guide for starters:
