JavaScript is forgiving. You can add almost anything with the plus operator. However, it's not always clear what the outcome will be. 


What's the output of the codes nippet below? 

```javascript
const myAwesomeString = 1+2+"A"+2+2+[]+"0";

console.log(myAwesomeString);
```

Hopefully you'll figure it out. Check tomorrow's article for the correct answer and an explaination of how it works.
