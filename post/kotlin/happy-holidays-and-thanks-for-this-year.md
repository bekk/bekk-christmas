  It's the 24th of December and a visit from Santa is right around the corner.
  The reindeer are eager and his sleigh is ready. He has determined who is
  naughty and who is nice. Perhaps by using [extension
  functions](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/9).

We may suspect that Santa's tech stack not always is the most up to date. Perhaps he used to run a pure Java-application, but after reading this calendar he decided to try to add some Kotlin, [just like Ã˜yvind](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/20).
