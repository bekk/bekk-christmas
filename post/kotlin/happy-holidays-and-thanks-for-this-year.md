  It's the 24th of December and a visit from Santa is right around the corner.
  The reindeer are eager and his sleigh is ready. He has determined who is
  naughty and who is nice.

We’ve covered a lot over the last twenty-four days! Twenty-four articles by thirteen authors. Yrjan kicked it of with [getting started with Kotlin](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/1) and after that the articles came in fast succession.  It's time for a recap!

We’ve looked at some of the language features Kotlin has to offer. Einar explained [null safety](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/2) and how to avoid NullPointerExceptions, Herman showed us how to use [data classes](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/10), and Øyvind told us [when](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/2) to when. We've looked at cute pictures of seals and Henrik wrote about [sealed classes](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/5), and Yrjan extended our knowledge about [extension functions](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/9). Sondre named some use cases for [named and default arguments](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/19), and Vegard explained [lambdas](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/18)!

We’ve also taken an in-depth look at some of the features of Kotlin. Jørund explored the [in’s and out’s](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/22) of Kotlin, Øyvind explained the difference between [lists and sequences](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/23). We’ve looked at [receivers](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/21) and Thomas explained when to use the [reified](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/15) and [inline](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/16) keywords.

Vetle, working in parallell, wrote a three part series about coroutines. An [introduction](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/12), looking in to [dispatchers](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/13), and exploring [channels and flows](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/14). 

Øyvind shared his experiences with [going from Java to Kotlin](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/20). Vegard gave us an introduction on how to [make games in Kotlin](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/11), Thomas talked about anti-bikeshedding and how to use [Klint](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/8), and Fedrink wrote an in-depth guide on how to use [typesafe error handling](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/17). 

KotlinConf! What an amazing conference. We covered some of the highlights of [last year](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/4) KotlinConf, and some of the highlights from both the [first day](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/6) and the [second day](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/7) of this years KotlinConf.


Phew! That's all from us this year, and thank *you* for reading. Happy holidays and who knows, maybe we'll see you again next year!
