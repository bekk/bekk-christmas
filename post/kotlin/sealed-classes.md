Sealed classes in Kotlin is a concept close to enums that we are used to from other programming languages. Similar to enums, the values defined in sealed classes are restricted. However â€” unlike enums â€” these values might also be an instance of a class containing state. This makes it possible to make more expressive models.

## How to declare a sealed class
To declare a sealed class, you put the `sealed` modifier in front of the class name. A sealed class can have subclasses, but all of them must be declared in the same file as the sealed class itself.

To illustrate some of the benefits of sealed classes, let's look into a simple example. In this example we are doing a payment with different payment methods:

```kotlin
sealed class PaymentMethod() {
  data class CreditCard(val token: String, val expireDate: String) : PaymentMethod()
  data class DirectPayment(val phonenumber: String) : PaymentMethod()
}
```

Each of these payment methods have different needs for data. When handling a `CreditCard` payment we need a `token` and an value for `expireDate`. Handling a `DirectPayment` only requires a `phonenumber`.

As we can se here, each of the classes have to extend the sealed class `PaymentMethod`. Every class defined inside `PaymentMethod`, might have their own state, extend state from `PaymentMethod` or even just be an `object` with no state at all. 

### Utilizing the `when` expression
The key benefit of sealed classes, can be seen using the `when` expression. As described earlier, there have to be an exact set of possible values when defining sealed classes. This restriction makes it possible for the compiler to do 
warn you if you are not handling all possible cases in the `when` expression.

In the following example we are trying to process a payment:

```kotlin
// Does not compile :(
fun processPayment(paymentMethod: PaymentMethod) =
  when (paymentMethod) {
    is PaymentMethod.CreditCard -> processCreditCardPayment(paymentMethod.token, paymentMethod.expireDated)
}
```

This code will not compile. Can you see what's missing in the `processPayment` function?ðŸ¤”

As you probably saw, we didn't handle all possible definitions of `PaymentMethod`. Let's fix the `processPayment` method:

```kotlin
// Compiles :)
fun processPayment(paymentMethod: PaymentMethod) =
  when (paymentMethod) {
    is PaymentMethod.CreditCard -> processCreditCardPayment(paymentMethod.token, paymentMethod.expireDated)
    is PaymentMethod.DirectPayment -> processDirectPayment(paymentMethod.phonenumber)
}
```

This will now compile since all possible cases of `PaymentMethod` is handled inside the `when` expression. 

Another benefit we also get here, is the use of smartcasting. When the `paymentMethod` matches one of the `is` statements - we can use the object directly without the need for explicit casting.

### Summary
Sealed classes gives us a new tool for creating cleaner and better data models. By by utilizing sealed classes with the `when` expression, the compiler will also help us to remember to handle all possible cases. Even though this sometimes might feel cumbersome, it will make the code more solid and more maintainable.
