title: Creating domain-specific languages
ingress: Kotlin introduces a lot of new language features for us developers.
  Those features allows us to create code that is type-safe, easy to write and
  easy to reason about. A good example of this are the type-safe builders a.k.a
  DSLs, and in this article we're taking a look at how we can create our own
  DSLs.
