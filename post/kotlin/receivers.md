Did you know that you can change the scope of functions? Itâ€™s pretty awesome. In Kotlin we can change the scope of our functions using receivers and the standard library uses it all the time. 

Let's take a look at the familiar `apply` function.


```
data class User(var username: String, val id: Int)
val user = User("Kris Kringle", 1234)
user.apply { 
    username = "Santa"
}
```

With `apply` we don't have to reference the object we are working with, and instead, we get a block where `this` refers to the object. In this example `username` implicitly refers to `user.username`. So how can we use this, and make the functions we write behave similar to `apply`?

Using lambdas with receivers we can do the same:

```
fun caps(user: User, text: User.() -> String): String = user.text().capitalize()

val user = User(username = "Santa", id = 1)
caps(user) {
    "$username!"
}

// result: SANTA!
```

If you're unfamiliar with how lambdas works in Kotlin, or you need a little refresher head over to the [post about lambdas](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/18). 

Ok, so let's take a closer look at whats happening in the example above. The `caps` function takes in a user and a lambda with some unusual syntax: `User.() -> String`. The weird syntax is the syntax for reducers, where the `User.` is the receiver type and `() -> String` is the function type. 

We have some nice syntactical sugar when working with receivers. Since `user` has the same type as the receiver we can call the lambda directly on it, instead of calling the lambda with the `user` as an argument. In this context `user.text()` is the same thing as `text(user)`. 

We can also expand on this and make a receiver function that takes arguments. If we want to make the caps function take in a suffix we could change it to:

```
fun caps(user: User, text: User.(String) -> String): String = user.text("!").capitalize()

caps(user) { suffix ->
    "$username$suffix"
}

// result: SANTA!
```

This looks very similar to the `with` standard function in Kotlin, which is not a keyword, but is in fact a function in the standard library.

Simplified `with` looks something like this:

```
fun <T, R> with(receiver: T, block: T.() -> R): R  = receiver.block()
```

We can also use receivers with extension functions. Let's change `caps` to be an extension function. 

```
fun User.caps(text: User.() -> String): String = text().capitalize()

val santa = User(username = "Santa", id = 1)
santa.caps {
    $username
}

// result: Santa!
```

When using extension functions this implicitly becomes the object we are extending, so we can call our lambda, `text`, without referencing the user object at all. Pretty sweet!

Now this is starting to looks very similar to `apply`. 

```
fun <T> T.apply(block: T.() -> Unit): T {
    block()
    return this
}
```


Receivers makes it possible us to create some pretty interesting things, but with great syntactical powers comes great responsibilities.
