Did you know that you can change the scope of functions? Itâ€™s pretty awesome. In Kotlin we can change the scope of functions using receivers and the standard library does it all the time. 

Let's take a closer look at the familiar `apply` function.

```kotlin
data class User(var username: String, val id: Int)
val user = User("Kris Kringle", 1234)
user.apply { 
    username = "Santa"
}
```

With `apply` we don't have to reference the object we are working with, and instead, we get a block where `this` refers to the object. This means that we can access properties like `username` implicitly without referring to `user.username`. Cool! But how can we make our own `apply` function?

Lambdas with receiver types is the answer! 

```kotlin
fun caps(user: User, text: User.() -> String): String = user.text().capitalize()

val user = User(username = "Santa", id = 1)
caps(user) {
    "$username!"
}

// result: SANTA!
```

*If you need a refresher on how lambdas work in Kotlin you can read about them in the [post about lambdas](https://kotlin.christmas/2019/18).*

Ok, so let's take a closer look at whats happening in the example above. The `caps` function takes in a user and a lambda with some unusual syntax: `text: User.() -> String`. What's happening here? We have the standard lambda function type `() -> String` prefixed with a type! The prefixed type is the receiver, and in our example the receiver is a `User`.

But what does this mean? So what we do is that we assign a new scope, or a receiver type, to our function. The context of `this` changes inside the lambda and we can now call everything on a `User` object without having to reference it.

```kotlin
fun caps(user: User, text: User.() -> String) =
       user.text().capitalize()
```

The second thing that might look slightly weird at first glimpse is the way the `text` function is called. It's called directly on the user-object as if it were an extension function. When working with lambdas with receivers we have some nice syntactical sugar. Since the parameter `user` has the same type as the receiver we can call the lambda directly on it, meaning that `user.text()` is the same thing as `text(user)`. 


The `caps` function looks very similar to the `with` standard function in Kotlin, which is not a keyword, but is in fact a function in the standard library. Let's compare them.

```
caps(user) {
    "$username!"
}

with(user) {
    "$username!"
}
```

Both `caps` and `with` changes the context of the code-block allowing us to refer directly to properties without referencing the object we are working on.

We can also use receivers with extension functions. Let's change `caps` to be an extension function. 

```
fun User.caps(text: User.() -> String): String = text().capitalize()
```

Since `this` in extension functions refer to the object it's extending we can call `text` directly, as our receiver type matches the type we are extending.  Pretty sweet!

```
fun User.caps(text: User.() -> String): String = text().capitalize()

val user = User(username = "Santa", id = 1)
user.caps {
    $username
}
```

With that simple change we made our `caps` function looks and behave more more like `apply` than `with`.

Receivers makes it possible us to create some pretty interesting things, but with great syntactical powers comes great responsibilities. Lambdas with receivers is a specialized tool we can use to change the context of lambdas!
