  Yesterday (the non-workshop part of) the third edition of KotlinConf kicked
  off. This year the conference is held in Copenhagen, the capitol of Denmark.
  While a visit to "Kongens by" is nice in any circumstance, a December visit
  with a taste of Kotlin is almost perfect.

## The venue 

This years venue is the Bella Conference Center _(pictured)_, a quick metro ride from central Copenhagen. While perhaps not as charming as last years venue (Beurs van Berlage in Amsterdam), a larger venue may be fitting to the ever growing Kotlin community.
