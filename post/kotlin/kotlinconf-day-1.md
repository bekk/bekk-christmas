  Yesterday (the non-workshop part of) the third edition of KotlinConf kicked
  off. This year the conference is held in Copenhagen, the capitol of Denmark.
  While a visit to "Kongens by" is nice in any circumstance, a December visit
  with a taste of Kotlin is almost perfect.

## The venue

This years venue is the Bella Conference Center _(pictured)_, a quick metro ride from central Copenhagen. While perhaps not as charming as last years venue (Beurs van Berlage in Amsterdam), a larger venue may be fitting to the ever growing Kotlin community.

The registration went smoothly, and after leaving our coats in the cloakroom, we went into the huge conference hall. While at first sight it felt a little crowded around the food and drink stations, as we moved further from the entrance the crowds thinned and we could easily help ourselves to some breakfast snacks and a much needed cup of coffee.

## Talks

As last year, the conference kicked off with a keynote.  Andrey Breslav presented some information on the recent developments and near future of Kotlin. (1.4 is on it's way!).  

### Putting Down the Golden Hammer

With great syntax comes great responsibility. Or, at least, with great syntax comes the temptation to use it everywhere, even places where you maybe shouldn't. In this talk [Huyen Tue Dao](https://twitter.com/queencodemonkey) shares with us some examples of going to far with the Kotlin syntax. 

Keep using the great features of Kotlin, but always make the intention of your code as clear as possible, even though that means writing `!!` or dropping an `apply`. I can wholeheartedly recommend this talk for both experienced and new Kotlin developers. 

### Kotless

A fantastic talk about [Kotless](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotless), a serverless framework, by [Vladislav Tankov](https://github.com/TanVD). The talk started with a short introduction to serverless and continued on about some of the issues with it. In theory serverless sounds really nice, as you don't have to deal with all the server infrastructure. In practise though it's slightly more complex. A simple serverless app often requires 500+ lines of infrastructure configuration that you as a developer have to deal with. Shouldn't it and couldn't it be done much easier?

The answer is yes, and Kotless. Kotless introspects your code and generates the configuration for you. It currently supports AWS and looks really promising. I'm personally looking forward to try this framework out!

### Kotlin for science

Simulations is an important part of modern natural science, especially for disciplines where experiments are time consuming and expensive. But to make simulations 

Kotlin has several strengths that gives it, including extensions 

//TODO Torbjørn

* Computer simulations
* Differential equations, 
* monte carlo
* kMath   

## Party

As we're writing this the first day is coming to an end, and we are waiting for an new product announcement from JetBrains. Then it's time to party! **Skål.kt** :beers:
