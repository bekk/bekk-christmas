  'Twas the night before KotlinConf when half a dozen developers from Bekk set
  afoot on a journey. Leaving the snow clad north behind, heading for warmer
  shores of sealed classes, co-routines and extension functions in Copenhagen. 


  Tomorrow the festivities, that are KotlinConf 2019, are upon us. And in that
  spirit we take time to look back at last years conference and some of the
  informative, inspiring and fun talks we witnessed in Amsterdam.

KotlinConf 2018 was held over two days in the Beurs van Berlage in central Amsterdam. After the keynote by (...), there was four talks in parallel trough-out- This presented a problem, as it was not always easy to choose which talk to attend. 

TODO: 

* litt om de forskjellige talks/fordrag (skal noen erstattes?)
* litt om det sosiale, nye bekjente p√• konferansen(?)

Lenker:

* [Beat the High-Score: Build a Game Using libGDX and Kotlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDxerDYelLs) by David Wursteisen\
  Game development
* [Making Noise with Kotlin Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc04QKnryKs) by Josh Skeen\
  Music! 
* [Best Practices for Unit Testing in Kotlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX_g65J14H0) by Philipp Hauer \
  Very informative, and perhaps the talk I've personally applied most at projects at work. 
* [Kotlin Puzzlers, vol 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq9vBZs0j-8) by Anton Keks\
  A tradition in the making? A fun way to end the conference.
