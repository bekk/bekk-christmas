  'Twas the night before KotlinConf when half a dozen developers from Bekk set
  afoot on a journey. Leaving the snow clad north behind, heading for warmer
  shores of sealed classes, co-routines and extension functions in Copenhagen. 


  Tomorrow the festivities, that are KotlinConf 2019, are upon us. And in that
  spirit we take time to look back at last years conference and some of the
  informative, inspiring and fun talks we witnessed in Amsterdam.

KotlinConf 2018 was held over two days in the Beurs van Berlage in central Amsterdam. After the keynote there was four talks in parallel trough-out. This presented a problem, as it was not easy to choose which talks to attend. But choices were made, and we will try to present some

## Kotlin Puzzlers
A tradition in the making? This was the second edition of the Kotlin Puzzlers, and the [schedule](https://kotlinconf.com/talks/6-dec/101328) confirms that there will be a third edition this year. Anton Keks presented absurd snippets of code and challenged the to audience vote for the correct result when running the code. After the answer was reviled, an audience member volunteered to explain the result.    

```
fun hello(): Boolean {
  println(print("Hello") == print("World") == return false)
}

hello()

// What will it print?
// a) HelloWorld
// b) HelloWorldfalse
// c) HelloWorldtrue
// d) will not compile 
```   
This was the first puzzler, can you explain what answer it will give and why? There may be some Estonian liqueur in it for you if you do...
