  'Twas the night before KotlinConf when half a dozen developers from Bekk set
  afoot towards "Kongens by". They boarded trains and planes, leaving the snow
  clad north behind, heading for the lights and music of Copenhagen. 


  Yes, tomorrow the festivities that are KotlinConf 2019 is upon us. And in that
  spirit we take time to look back at last years conference and some of the
  informative, fun and (...) talks we witnessed in Amsterdam.
