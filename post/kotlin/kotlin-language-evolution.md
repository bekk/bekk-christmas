title: Kotlin language evolution
ingress: >+
  The year 2020 has certainly been a special one, but that hasn't stopped
  Jetbrains from continuing its work on the Kotlin language and its ecosystem.

  In March we got the 1.3.70 version, an incremental release, which included some new functions and classes in the standard library. And after the summer break we got the all new 1.4.0 version, a feature release, which came with some really sought after changes to the language and even more changes to the standard library.
