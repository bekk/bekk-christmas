title: Anti-bikeshedding with ktlint
---
When you have two or more people working on the same codebase, there is bound to be disagreements. It might be about larger things such as the architecture or what framework to use. It might be about smaller things, like the number of spaces used for indentation or the order of modifiers.

Meet ktlint, ''an anti-bikeshedding Kotlin linter with built-in formatter'', which is here to help you with the small things!

## Wait, bikeshedding? ğŸ™‹

What, you haven't heard of this term before? What about [Parkinson's law of triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality)? No?

Me neither! In short, the term bikeshedding stems from the aforementioned 'law' which argument that ''members of an organization give disproportionate weight to trivial issues''. Here, an example.

> While building a nuclear power plant, large issues such as the size of the workforce and the budget for the containment vessels are passed without much hassel as there are just a few experts fronting each issues. However, when the small issue of a bikeshed is raised, everyone has an opinion, so the issue drags on and ends up claiming a larger part of the meeting then the rest of the large issues combined.

For a full version, I recommend the blog post [Bikeshedding](https://exceptionnotfound.net/bikeshedding-the-daily-software-anti-pattern/). Just remember the gist; we tend to spend too much time on trivial things, especially when we compare it to larger things.

So in other words, an ''anti-bikeshedding'' tool is a tool which aims to tackle the small and trivial issues, so that you won't have to!
