## What is StrictMode and why should i use it?

StrictMode is a feature which was introduced to React 16.3 already in march 2018. Still, chances are you've never used it before. StrictMode does not render anything visual (similar to `Fragment`), but detects potential problems in your code and gives you helpful warnings.

StrictMode helps you with:
1) Identifying unsafe lifecycles
2) Warning about legacy string ref API usage
3) Warning about deprecated `findDOMNode` usage
4) Detecting unexpected side effects
5) Detecting legacy context API


## How to use StrictMode?

Using StrictMode is amazingly easy: all you have to do is to wrap whatever you want to use StrictMode on inside `<React.StrictMode />`. This can be your entire `<App />`:

```js 
<React.StrictMode>
  <App>
    <Component 1 />
    <Component 2 />
  </App>
</React.StrictMode>
```

Or just a single component:

```js 
<App>
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Component 1 />
  </React.StrictMode>
  <Component 2 />
</App>
```
