## What is StrictMode and why should I use it?

StrictMode is a feature which was introduced to React 16.3 already in march 2018.

StrictMode does not render anything visible (similar to `Fragment`), but detects potential problems in your code and gives you helpful warnings. With the introduction of Hooks earlier this year and React 17 just around the corner, StrictMode is becoming an increasingly powerful tool for locating bad practices.

## How to use StrictMode?

Using StrictMode is amazingly easy: all you have to do is to wrap whatever you want to use StrictMode on inside `<React.StrictMode />`. This can be your entire `<App />`:

    <Component1 />
    <Component2 />
  </App>
</React.StrictMode>
```

Or just a single component:

```js 
<App>
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Component1 />
  </React.StrictMode>
  <Component2 />
</App>
```
