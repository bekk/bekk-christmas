title: Why (not) make a design system?
ingress: >-
  Design is complex - and ever increasingly so. It requires full collaboration
  between all teams and professions involved in the process. A shared design
  language makes teams work together more effectively. That’s why companies
  invest in design systems. But how can we make sure that it works for our
  product and improves our productivity?

Design systems should let product teams take a systematic approach to their work. But all design systems are not equally effective. Some help product teams create coherent experience; others produce confusing designs. We can measure the system's success by how well it helps us achieve the purpose of the product.

## What is the reason you need a design system?

Perhaps you are creating a solution to an imaginary problem? Or do you just want a design system because others have one? None of these reasons suffices - obviously.

Creating a design system is time-consuming. And it could easily slow a small team down instead of moving them forward. The time you spend building a design system, you can't spend building a product. And if you don't have a clear direction, creating a design system risks being a waste.

A design system should come from the need to increase efficiency – when work are being slowed down by lack of design directions. But you also have to consider this mechanism: Those who create the design system believes firmly in its importance, and those who it's meant for tend to think they do better without it.

## How do you make it work?
