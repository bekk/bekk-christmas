title: About being new to React
ingress: My name is Tora, I am 24 years old and I have just finished my master’s
  degree in Computer Science. When I first started working here at Bekk this
  fall I was almost completely new to React. I had only attended a few half-day
  courses during my years as a student and I was now assigned to a complex
  project written in React. This was an exciting and new world to me, and I
  would like to let you in on my journey so far. Whether you’re a React pro or a
  complete beginner like me, you might learn a thing or two!

## Where to start?

When I first was introduced to my project, I quickly learned that we are using React with Typescript. However, some parts are written with modern React using Hooks and some parts are written with an older version of React. Now, you might wonder what Hooks are. I was thinking the same thing as well. But first things first, with a guiding hand from my colleague, we jumped right into it and started peer-programming on smaller tasks such as “Add a new button” or “Create a new filter”. These tasks were easy to start with, seeing as I could study similar code from other places in the application and try to replicate the logic. Along the way, my colleague and mentor explained concepts such as hooks and components. I also used the React docs [(LINK?)](https://reactjs.org/) actively to better understand the theoretical concepts I was introduced to and wrote down key takeaways from our solutions. So, what is a Hook? In my notebook from the 2nd of September, I had written down a small explanation.

*A Hook lets you use state and other React features without writing a class.*

Next, we began refactoring older React into modern React. This helped me understand what Hooks were actually used for, by seeing all the lines of code that could now be replaced with a simple Hook. My experience with this approach was good. It was a smooth beginning to start refactoring code and just focus on syntax, instead of also solving logical problems and implementing new functionality in an unknown language.

## Online courses, another approach?

So far, my approach has been to dive right into a problem and use React to solve it. However, it is also possible to start with a beginner’s course, such as [this workshop](https://github.com/bekk/react-intro) (in Norwegian). Here, you will work through different topics and solve small tasks related to that specific topic. This approach might give you a better theoretical understanding of what it is that you are actually coding. For instance, I’ve experienced that sometimes I didn’t understand that I had learned about Hooks already, simply because we had not talked about the concept of what we were implementing. Nonetheless, an online course will not give you the same practical experience as working on a more complex project so it’s necessary to find a balance that works for you.

For me personally, I learn best by reading and writing and not just by viewing and listening to other people explain things to me. I have previously tried online courses with other technologies, but my experience is that I generally don’t really learn what I am supposed to because of the lack of repetition and experience. Peer-programming with a more experienced colleague has been great. I feel that I can challenge myself and try what I think is a possible solution, while at the same time I have my colleague besides me who can give me small hints and explain when I stumble across something new.

As with anything that you are trying to learn, I recommend that you reflect on which learning style suits you best. If you would like to just dive right into a project like me, but you’re unsure of where to start t[his page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) can be useful. And if you’re the type that likes to start from scratch and have small explanations for everything you do, maybe some of these workshops can be useful:

* [React and TypeScript](https://github.com/bekk/typet-javascript-workshop)
* [Animations in React](https://github.com/bekk/react-animation-workshop)
* [Testing React apps](https://github.com/bekk/react-test-workshop)

## What’s next?

So, am I a professional React coder now? Absolutely not. But I do know what a component is, I am more comfortable with using Hooks, and I am not completely lost when I have to solve a problem on my own in a never-before seen file in our project. Going forwards, I would like to focus on better understanding the theoretical concepts behind my code so that I can make more conscious decisions when developing. I also hope that I will feel confident enough in React to be able to help my new colleagues that will join our project next year! Maybe one day I will even understand what the ReactDOM really is.
