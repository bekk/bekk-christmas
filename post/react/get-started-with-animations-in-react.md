  would make your life easier? Or perhaps you just want to have fun and learn

There are several approaches on how to make things move in a React app, and Framer-Motion an amazing library that gets you started with implementing cool fast. It is the successor to the popular library Pose, and while Pose is  marketed as “A truly simple animations library for React”, the creators of Framer-Motion claims that “Motion attempts to make the API even simpler for the simplest cases, yet more flexible to handle the most advanced”. In other words, even if you already know Pose it may be valuable to learn and start using Framer-Motion instead. Also, there are similarities, so the switch should not be too comprehensive. But enough chit chat, lets get started with some code examples!
