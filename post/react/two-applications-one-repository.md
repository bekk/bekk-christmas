  When youâ€™re developing similar apps for web and native platforms, it is hard
  to find a project structure that works well. Let us take a look at how our
  team is approaching this challenge for maintaining different view layers, as
  well as a shared business logic at the same time.

## The Web and the Native

Currently our colleagues and us are developing the web and the native application for a company named Entur, which provides a journey planner for public transport in Norway. These applications lets the user plan their journey, buy tickets, create a profile, add payment options, and other functionalities. To be able to create this awesomeness, and as you may have guessed based on this calendar, we are using React for web and React Native for iOS and Android.

We have that (dis)advantage that the web and native application mostly (but not a 100%) contains the same functionality. And as you may have foreseen, this creates two versions of our code based on our choice of technology. We wan to have the same business logic for both of the applications, but didn't want it to mess with the views. We wanted to separate the views from the business logic, but at the same time minimize the duplication of the code. Therefore, we ended up with a monorepo.

## The Monorepo

A monorepo is just a repository containing several projects, and how you structure it will affect the developer experience. 
When developing Feature X for the web application, where does it make the most sense to put your views/components that will be 95% identical to the one for native? The answer here is not easy, and it is totally independent of the developer. However, we decided to divide our code into subfolders across web and native, called **domain packages**.

### Packages

We create subfolders that covers web and native and we separate them by the domain (we feel) they belong to. For instance we have created a subfolder for everything regarding the profile page, and another folder for things that travel suggestions (called journey). By doing it this way we are able to easier compare the components and share the business logic across web and native without too much overhead.
In addition to the domain packages we have a `client-app` and `client-web` folder which is the entry point for the different applications.

Here is a rough snippet of our structure:

```
packages
    |_ client-app
        |_ index.js
    |_ client-web
        |_ index.js
    ...
    |_ journey
        |_ index.native.js
        |_ index.web.js
    |_ profile
        |_ index.native.js
        |_ index.web.js
    ...
```

Actions, reducers, sagas and helper files are typically files we use to share between the applications. They are put in separate files and folders in the current domain packages, and since both the web and app components are in short distance of each other, there are no problem accessing it. 

```
|_ profile
    |_ index.native.js
    |_ index.web.js
    |_ helper.js
    |_ reducers
    |_ actions
    ...
```

There are both positive and negative sides when working with a monorepo. Personally, we like the domain package structure we are going for. At first look it seems a little bit chaotic, but when you get used to the domain logic it is pretty nice! Of course it is a pickle to know when to create a new package, and when to not or even delete one. For example, in our case the product we are creating is a journey planner, and it is super hard not to put everything in the `journey` domain package! ðŸ˜… And of course, we have the one folder, the `utils`-folder, where all the stuff we don't know where to put is placed!

Furthermore, when you are done developing a feature for one of the platforms, it is relatively easy to develop it for the other. Because all the work with the heavy logic, developing, and thinking is already done. Most of the time it is remaining to "port" the views from native to web or vice versa. Of course it isn't always as easy to convert one view from native to web, there are some corner cases in the business logic, something with the url chaos (logged in vs. not etc.), and the styling when it comes to vertical vs. horizontal design.

A monorepo is just fun and games, **after** you have configured the correct setup.

### The setup

If deciding on a project structure is not difficult itself, getting the tooling and supported frameworks to work is another uphill battle. 

First, importing internal and external modules. Needless to say, We do not worry about whether a module is part of the monorepo or from an external repository, like NPM. Luckily, **Yarn** has a feature tailored towards monorepos called _workspaces_. It solves the issues of symlinking modules together, de-duplicating dependencies across packages, and keeping it all in a single yarn.lock file. As a result dependency resolution works just as you would expect. Need to access an exported module from another package? Just add `import { something } from "@entur/profile"`. And if you need to add a dependency to one of the packages, just run `yarn add date-fns`. The only difference from a traditional javascript repository is that you have one package.json for every package, in addition to the root package.json.  

#### Bundling

Second, bundle everything. Building the applications for two different targets requires two different build systems. For web we use **Webpack** and for React Native - **Metro**. Both systems implements the same concept, one main entry file with references (directly or indirectly) to the entire application, which is then traced and bundled into a single file. When separate implementations is required for the different applications, a .web.js or .native.js file extension can be added to expose the file to only one of the build systems. Metro has built in support for .native.js, and Webpack can be configured to also accept .web.js.

#### Third parties

Thanks to Yarn workspace module resolution works out of the box. However, library developers some times requires files to exist in a certain location. When there is no way to override config, or get a pull-request accepted, the last resort is to patch source files. If youâ€™re new to patching, check out [Mats Byrkjelandâ€™s writeup to patch your node_modules](https://opensource.christmas/2019/4). The advantage of patching is that you can make the change as specific as you need. The disadvantage is now you have to support the patch for every library update. Luckily not all files change every release, and patching is rare (usual a last resort).

## Other Possibilities

Monorepo is not the only solution when developing for native and web. When these applications was created, we had absolutely all the business logic on the client side which affected the choice having one repository. Over the years we have moved more of our logic over to cloud functions (see the article written by Carl Joachim about [Firebase functions in Entur](https://thecloud.christmas/2019/17)), that may have influenced the decision of a monorepo vs. several repositories today. 

Another possibility when developing for native and web, is the `react-native-web`. It provides much of the logic and code of [React Native for the web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web). We tried to use this as a part of our project, but decided to remove it due to the lack of semantics. Also, the div-o-rama that goes along with the native code bleeds over to the web applications. An example is the repetetive styling you need for React Native components, which is separate styling for each view due to the lack inheritance for native. In addition we had rarely a 100% one-to-one connection between native and web, which in most cases would create separate views. 

So, all-in-all, it is hard to give a "correct answer" of what you should use when developing for web and native applications. However, even with the complexity of the setup we have been through, we are satisfied with our structure and would recommend it to others struggling with the decision of the setup of your projects!
