  Suspense is and will become a game changer when it comes to data fetching. It
  changes the way we structure our code, think about loading states and gives a
  better experience for both the developers and the users' interface.

Suspense lets you delay the rendering of parts of the application tree until a condition is met. This condition can either be that an asset is loaded or, soon, that data is fetched. While waiting for the condition to be met, Suspense will render a fallback component instead. This might be a spinner, a loading animation or any other dumb component.
