  If you want to do front-end development, React is a great tool to have in your
  tool chest. However - in a sea of content large enough to drown in - where
  should you look for resources to learn React?

React is the most popular frontend framework by any standard today. There are in excess of two million developers using it, and a lot has been written about it.

Even though this is great in many regards, it also comes with down side - it's impossible to figure out where to turn for good content! So with a bit of tongue in cheek - here's yet **another** article on how you could get started with React. 

What makes this one a bit different, is that I'm in charge of training hundreds of aspiring (or newly hired) developers every year. I've spent a lot of time researching ways to both teach and learn React, and I think I got it down to a science by now. The list is in order, so if you've touched on some of these topics before, feel free to skip ahead.

So if you're a senior systems engineer that's looking to pick up some frontend skills on the side, or if you're just starting out - this list should help you to get started

## Skip Redux, Webpack, Babel et al

React is often coupled with a state management tool called Redux. Redux is a great tool for when you need it, but it's not something you need to know right away. Same goes for other tools you might encounter with React, such as Webpack, Babel, sagas, GraphQL and tons of other ones.

Skip all of that. If you see a tutorial with one of those in the title - Marie Kondo that shit, or save it for later.

## Read the React docs from beginning to end

It might sound a bit boring, sure, but it's the best advice you're gonna get. The React documentation has been written, vetted and improved by hundreds of people over the course of half a decade. It's being translated into [48 different languages](https://isreacttranslatedyet.com/) (!), and is just a fantastic resource in every single way. It's well written, well structured, and is split up into chewable parts you can fly through in a few minutes each.

Read through its [main concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html), [cool game tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), and even some of the [advanced guides](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html) if you're feeling adventurous.

There's a huge section on the more "modern" way to use React as well - [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) - which you should skim through as well. It's definitely the way forward, so spend the time you need to with this material, too.

Finally, I suggest you get familiar with the [API reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html). You don't need to go through this one right away, but know that it's there for when you finally need to use one of those exotic APIs you rarely see in the wild.

## Check out Kent C. Dodds' Beginners Guide to React

If you're into video courses and screen casts, you're going to love this. Honestly, even if you're _not_ into screen casts, you're going to love this. 

You'll find it for free on [Egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react), and it's 19 videos totalling a very manageable 77 minutes of content. 

Even seasoned React vets have something to learn in this video series. He'll take you through creating and updating nodes in the DOM manually, doing the same with regular JS-based React, and then showing you how to turn that into that mystical super juice called JSX. And tons of other stuff.

## Follow along with Michael Chan on his holiday adventures

After reading the docs and watching Dodds' beginner guide, you're starting to really have the good feels for this fantastic little framework we all love and enjoy.

Michael Chan - also known as chantastic - runs the React Podcast, but every holiday season he sits down to do something really cool for the community. This year, he's created a 24 part series, where he's presenting React step by step. 

It's perfect for both experienced devs and for people just starting out.
