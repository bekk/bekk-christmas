Toasts are great, so simple but yet so useful. It is for many a part of their daily life, which is why we will today provide one of the quickest and simplest recipes for making toast. Let's dive in.

## Ingredients needed

* Context API
* Hooks

I would like to clarify that we are going to build a toast notification system using the **context api** and **hooks** from react just to avoid any confusion with regular, delicious toast. These are relatively new tools which makes life a whole lot easier when working with both small-scale and especially large-scale code. A very brief explanation of each tool is:

**Context API -** A state management system that fixes many problems or annoyances that comes with handling different components state. The most basic approach for managing state is that each component uses `React.setState(..)` to handle its own internal state. But this can get messy real quick which is why tools such as e.g Redux are used, but these tools are not perfect either. This is where the Context Api comes in, trying to make these imperfections a bit better just to ease state management a little more.

**Hooks -** React hooks are basically functions that lets the user build functional components that can implement state and lifecycle features that were previously only available to components created by `React.createComponent()`. There are however some 'issues' with components created by `React.createComponent()`, e.g that its hard to reuse logic in the lifecycle functions. This is why, long story short, hooks came about.
