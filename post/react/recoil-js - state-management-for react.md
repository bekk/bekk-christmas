### What is Recoil ?

[Recoil.js](https://recoiljs.org/) is a new state management library for [React](https://www.google.com/search?q=reactjs&rlz=1C5CHFA_enNO890NO890&oq=reactjs&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4j69i60l3.1252j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) ‚Äî‚Ääoffering a React-ish API and a simple and powerful way of dealing with global, asynchronous and derived state üî•

Recoil aims to solve some specific challenges when working with modern React apps like *flexible shared state*, *derived state* and *global observation*.

If you have worked with React it should seem familiar. Just take a look at this example. First we use React with useState() to increment a number:

```js
// React and setState

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <span>Count: {count}</span>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

Now, making our counter global is pretty streight forward using Recoil. All we need to do (almost üòá) is replacing **useState** with **useRecoilState.**

```js
//React and Recoil

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useRecoilState(myGlobalCounterState); ‚¨Ö

  return (
    <>
      <span>Count: {count}</span>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

TNot convinced ? keep on reading.. üòÑ

### What's great about Recoil ?

Libraries for React are constantly appearing, but [Recoil.js](https://recoiljs.org) is much more than just ‚Äúanother library‚Äù. Compared to other state libraries for React, Recoil feels like a fresh breath from the future - and it's great in so many ways:

#### Tailored for React

Recoil is made specifically for React and offers close compatibility with features React Suspense, Concurrent mode and the team claims to support new React features as they become available.

#### Easy to learn

When I tried Recoil I realized how complicated and difficult other state libraries like Redux really was.

Recoil offers a simple API, with semantics and behavior in a known reactish manner. It also comes "boilerplate-free". All you need to get started is to wrap your code with RecoilRoot.

```js
import { RecoilRoot } from "recoil";

ReactDOM.render(
    <RecoilRoot> ‚¨ÖÔ∏è
      <App />
    </RecoilRoot>,‚¨ÖÔ∏è
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

#### Handle derived state like a boss

Derived state is state based on some other state. When you have both async and syncronous state, this can be challenging. With Recoil, state can be replaced with derived data without modifying the components that use it

### Using Recoil - Examples

The examples below are taken from a simple demo application called FoodTalk. The app lets you sort, filter and search for recipes. Take a look at the [demo](https://emilmork.github.io/recoil-foodtalk-demo/) or the source code on [github](https://github.com/emilmork/recoil-foodtalk-demo).

Its a simple app, but it uses Recoil to solve some known challenges pretty well:




##### Atoms

An atom is simply a piece of state. It's exactly like react setState, except that it can be subscribed by any component. By updating the atom value, all subscribed components will be re-rendered. In our recipe application we use an atom to store our search text value:

```js
import { atom } from "recoil";

export const searchState = atom({
  key: "searchStateKey",
  default: "",
});
```

To read and write to this atom we use a hook called `useRecoilState`.

```js
import { useRecoilState } from "recoil";

export default () => {
  const [search, setSearch] = useRecoilState(searchState);

  return (
      <input
        value={search}
        onChange={(e) => {
          setSearch(e.target.value);
        }}
      />
};
```

##### Selectors

Selectors is a piece of derived state. Just like a pure function, selectors can modify existing state and return something new instead. In our recipe application we use a selector to combine different filters to return a filtered list of recipipes.

```js
import { selector } from "recoil";

export const filteredRecipesState = selector({
    key: "filteredRecipes",
    get: ({ get }) => {
      const recipes = await fetchRecipes(); // async

      const searchValue = get(searchState); // sync

      return recipes
          .filter(r => r.name.indexOf(searchValue) >= 0);
    },
  });
```

We can use the useRecoilValue() hook to read the value of filteredRecipesState.
The cool thing here is that if our search state changes, our selector state will trigger a change as well.

```js
const { useRecoilValue } from 'recoil';

const Recipes = () => {
  const filteredItems = useRecoilValue(filteredItemsState);

  ...
};
```
