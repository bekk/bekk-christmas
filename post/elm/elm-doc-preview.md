Wow! It's Christmas Eve, and elm.christmas is drawing to a close. We've published 24 articles, and I want to thank you for visiting our advent calendar, regardless of whether you've read all 24 articles, or if this is the first one you've read.

This last article won't be long, as I just want to highlight a neat tool that you might not have used for your Elm project.

## Elm Doc Preview

I remember being really inspired by Richard Feldman's [keynote talk at Elm Europe 2018](https://youtu.be/x1FU3e0sT1I), and on the plane from Paris I was in the middle of rewriting of my side project using some of the techniques from that talk, when I needed to check the documentation of a package at [package.elm-lang.org](https://package.elm-lang.org). The only problem was that I was 30 000 feet above France, with no Internet access.

## Lastly...

Lastly I want to thank every one who contributed to this years elm.christmas.
