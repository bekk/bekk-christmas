ingress: One of the great advantages of elm is its strong runtime guarantees,
  and one important technique it uses to achieve this is using data type such as
  *Maybe* and *Result* to handle errors, instead of having values like `null` or
  `undefined` in the language. These structures are very nice to work with, but
  if you don't know the tools at your disposal, they can be tricky.

Suppose you have some data such as:

```elm

```

This was supposed to be a list of integers, but for whatever reason whoever provided you with this data also left in a bunch of garbage like `"a87"`. You're only interested in the strings that are valid integers, and you also want to work with them as integers, not strings. Let's start writing our `convert` function.

We can convert strings to integers with the function

```elm

```

and we can use our old friend `List.map` to apply the conversion to all the elements in the list:

```elm

```

Now we have our integers, wrapped in `Just`, so all we have to do now is to remove the values that are `Nothing`.

"I know this one! That's `List.filter`, right?", you might have said prior to learning the lesson that I am getting to in this post. Let's try.

```elm

```

There are two problems with this solution:

First of all, `isJust` is not provided by the core library. We could get it from `elm-community/maybe-extra`, or we could save ourselves a dependency and just define it ourselves:

```elm

```

Now we can see if it works:

```elm

```

We got rid of the bad entries, but we have another problem. All our values are still wrapped up in `Just`! Each time you would want to use these values, you would have to handle the case of it being `Nothing`, even though we just made sure all the `Nothing`-values are gone. We have now introduced an impossible state ðŸ’€. What we really want is a function with the type

```elm

```

as opposed to what we had, which was:

```elm

```

Fortunately the solution is very simple! The core library provides the function which does exactly this:

```elm

```

List.filterMap takes a function that produces a Maybe, and applies that functions two all the elements of a list while unpacking the `Just`-values, and removing the `Nothing`-values.

Our final convert function can then be defined as simply as:

```elm

```

## Conclusion

Error handling in elm is easy as long as you you have the right functions in your toolbelt. With `List.filterMap` and a few more you will be able to handle anything ðŸŽ‰
