ingress: Elm doesn't have nulls or undefineds. What it does have is the Maybe
  type and while it's a pleasent type to work with, it might take some getting
  used to if you're coming from a language like Java or Python. Let's take a
  look at how we perform some basic operations over the Maybe type.
