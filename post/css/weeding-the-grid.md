I'm a strong beliver in learning by doing. If you are like me, then you might have read about CSS grids, but not yet used it. Well, that changes now!

[Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) is a cute little game that let you try out positioning in CSS Grid in a quick and fun manner. Head over there and have a few minutes for yourself meditating in this bussy time of the years while weeding your virutal guarden!
