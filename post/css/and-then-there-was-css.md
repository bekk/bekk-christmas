Hey there! In this calendar, we will share CSS tips and tricks, but first, a short recap.

In the beginning, there was HTML. As the language grew and more browsers created, styling quickly became a problem. The different browsers had "built-in" styling. This made it hard to make a website have the same appearance across different browsers. The idea of separating structure from the presentation was proposed to link styling to a document and to make it possible to have a different presentation of the same content for different mediums, such as screen and print.

There were several proposals to solve how to style markup, among them the first draft of CSS made by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie. Together with Bert Bos, Lie developed his proposal into CSS 1. CSS 1 was published in December 1996, and Internet Explorer, which was released the same year, implemented this standard partially. Internet Explorer 5 was the first browser to support more than 99% of the CSS 1 specification in the year 2000. Other browsers followed and also implemented parts of CSS 2.

This was the start of a chaotic period were the different browsers that supported different features of CSS. The browsers had different quirks and often had incorrect implementations of the features. This was not a good period for developers, as creating websites that looked consistent across different browsers was almost impossible. The developers were forced to create websites that worked by not following the standard, but the quirks of the browsers. When later versions of the browsers corrected their implementation of CSS, they had to add backward compatibility. So instead of the new browser defaulting to the better CSS implementation, developers had to specify that the website intended to use the newer version of the CSS implementation. Many developers suffered without need as they were not aware of this new CSS implementation that they could turn on and make their days better.

Fast Forward to today and most browsers support CSS2 in a consistent way, making the development experience a lot better. But CSS is still developing, providing new features that let us get even more out of our markup. But this also creates much frustration as we are often living on the bleeding edge knowing that some browsers support features we want to use, but knowing some browsers still don't support them.

There seem to be some frustrations styling websites still. Some libraries try to make the development experience better, but they often bloat your markup. It seems like because HTML and CSS seem so simple, it is easy not to get to know basic principles one should know to take full advantage of the languages. It's easy to try something and see if it works, but this often creates problems later on.

To improve on this situation, and frankly, because we think CSS is awesome, we are sharing articles with tips and tricks throughout the rest of the days in this Christmas calendar!
