Gleðileg jól! God jul! Merry Christmas! Happy holidays! Feliz navidad! When I first was told that I had the opportunity to write the last post for our CSS christmas calendar 

Christmas eve, or julaften as we indigenous Norwegians call it.



It's been one hell of a ride folks. From all of us to all of you, a very merry Christmas!
