> Volkswagen detects when your tests are being run in a CI server, and makes them pass.

Remember when Volkswagen were [tampering with their emissons tests](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/volkswagen-uses-software-to-fool-epa-pollution-tests/)? Now there's a great way to emulate this for your software tests! Fake tests passing on all sorts of build servers ðŸ˜„ It suuports TeamCity, Travis CI, GitLab CI and lots more! 

Visit [the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen) to learn more and have a good laugh ðŸ˜„
