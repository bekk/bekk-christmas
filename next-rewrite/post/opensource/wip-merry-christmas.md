## Spirit of Christmas & Open source

Like the spirit of Christmas, the spirit of Open source is spending time on what you love and who you love, and giving your time to aid others in need. 

I hope that this calendar and its authors has given you the inspiration and motivation to help out someone who can use your time and knowledge. Contributing might even take you to new places but you won't know until you've tried ðŸ˜‰

From all of us behind the Bekk Open source advent calendar to all of you, we wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year!
