It’s been a weird year, but something never changes, and this year Vegard kicked off the calendar with [Immutability](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/1). Some things do change though and Nicklas took us through the [Kotlin changelog](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/2). 

This year we’ve looked at many of the Kotlin features and resources for [learning Kotlin](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/23). Matias taught us how to [delegate](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/18) and [destruct](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/4), Jobi knitted an article of [strings templates](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/6) and demystified the magic behind the Kotlin [collections](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/22). Eivind explained [Operator Overloading](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/13) and how we can add new operators to our code.

We’ve taken a look at some of the nice and naughty libraries we can use with Kotlin. Tia took a look at the naughty [Gson library](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/8) and the nice [Spek Framework](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/11). Kristoffer taught us how we can use [MockK](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/12) for figuring out if something is nice or naughty and Nicklas showed us how we can make Kotlin write the code for us with [Kotlinpoet](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/14).

We’ve had some good discussions. We’ve written about when and why to use [let, apply, run and also](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/3) and Eirik explained the difference between [companion objects and top level vals](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/15).

Sondre has given us two fantastic introductions to the Kotlin tooling integrated with Intellij. How to use the [Kotlin REPL](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/19) and how to better understand the Christmas mysteries using the [bytecode viewer and decompiler](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/5). 

Kotlin has introduced a lot of new things over the last few years and we’ve taken a closer look at some of these. [Contracts](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/17) to help the compiler better understand our intent, [functional Interfaces](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/21) as a better alternative to typealiases. [It's (Christmas) Time for Kotlin](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/20) when Jobi explains the new Kotlin time API and Nicklas explains the new [serialization](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/9) library.

We’ve also deep dived in some of the more magical parts of Kotlin. Matias gave us insight into [type classes](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/7), Sondre about the [reified keyword](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/10) and Nicklas on how to write your own [domain specific languages](https://kotlin.christmas/2020/16).

All that's left now is to wish you all happy holidays. Happy holidays!
