# The Code Book
If you want a history lesson about the fascinating story of cryptography, look no further, the book by Simon Singh from 2000 has you covered. From ancient codes to modern cryptography, Singh gives an insightful, yet page turning tale of politics, war and bright minds. Throughout the book the reader is taken through both the history and some of the math behind this ever-challenging topic. Singh clearly has a good understanding of both the theory and the application of codes. The book even has a young readers version, maybe this could be a gift for an aspiring code breaker.
