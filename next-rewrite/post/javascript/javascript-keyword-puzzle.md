We really hope you've enjoyed our advent calendar. Please let us know on Twitter (_#dotchristmas_) if you did!

For our very last article in this advent calendar, we've made you a JavaScript-themed puzzle for when you're in need of a break from your beloved family members.

[Head on over to Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13rFyQ7e4T0ccmpuJ_DS_BSJzdsvrplpWtv5HzeKD0Es) to make your own [copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13rFyQ7e4T0ccmpuJ_DS_BSJzdsvrplpWtv5HzeKD0Es/copy) and start punching in those JavaScript keywords.

Have fun, and thanks for following along ❤️

See you next year!
